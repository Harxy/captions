Chapter 4./nSketching the API of a Target class.

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:08,914
I'm just going to make a scratch
directory here and try something out.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:23,657
Yes,I'm thinking I want to do
something like this; require scratch target. 

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:37,897
And hello_js is a target with a path.

5
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:45,005
We've not doing Haskel,(whoops). 

6
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:54,468
The minimum... It has a parse name
which is the file it's going to generate.

7
00:00:54,514 --> 00:01:05,440
and then it has a list of commands
that are how to generate that thing.

8
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,685
TS: What do you mean by target here?

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:17,165
JC: A target is a file (I guess I'm borrowing
some nomenclature from make here), 

10
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:23,211
but a target is any of the files in your system.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,022
So when you talk about hello.js is
derived from hello.coffee, hello.js is the target. 

12
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:35,657
They can either derived things or primary things, like your source code.
TS: I suppose in this case hello.js is both a target and also its going to be the input to the target.
