Chapter 10.
Checking the mtime of the Target.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,920
The other thing is they should be lazy.

3
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:15,920
So if you run the build and make no changes
then run it again nothing should happen. 

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,325
Builds take a long time as your project grows,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,090
especially minifying
javascript, it can get very slow.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,125
A simple way to do this is to look
at the modified times of the files,

7
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:35,897
and if any of the things that you depend on
are newer than your own file, then you rebuild.

8
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,971
Otherwise you don't.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,982
TS: Just to clarify can you talk us through... 

10
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:47,954
You've already addressed one case
about unnecessary work being done. 

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,902
You've made some change that
ensures something doesn't get done twice. 

12
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:57,417
And now you're making another change which
is also about something not being done twice,

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,782
but in a different way.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,325
TS: So the change you've already made,

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,480
what kind of case has that dealt
with that hasn't been dealt with here?

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:14,342
JC: If you have a build that has a diamond shape so you have your build that you want, and that depends on two things, then they both depend on one thing.
TS: OK.
So when you call build here it will call build on these two, and they will both call build on that thing. I just made it so that those two builds to the same target don't cause work to be duplicated within the same process.
TS: Right.
JC:we're now talking about when you run your build twice, the second time you run it if you haven't changed anything, no work should need to be done. It skips you waiting around for things that don't need to be recompiled or whatever it is that you need to be doing.
Its duplicate work within one build, and then across multiple builds.
TS: Ok
