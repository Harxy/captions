00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,908
Chapter 05
Unit testing the Target class.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,790
JC: So this is an example that I
should probably turn into a test now.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,034
There's not really enough here that there's
any integration vs unit test separation . 

4
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,428
There's only a tiny amount of code.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:28,720
So I think I'll start by moving target into the
source code of the project and write a test for it.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:39,634
Let's make a thing called lib,
and let's move scratch target into... 

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:52,925
No let's make a directory called  lib.fakemake,
and then move scratch target to that. 

8
00:00:55,394 --> 00:01:02,020
Then also name spacer... Like that. 

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,737
OK.

10
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,765
And we're going to want some
tests, and something to run them.

11
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,760
Go to inaud and get some gems. Gem file. Put rspec in there... save that, and install it into the project.
