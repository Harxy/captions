00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:03,977
[Chapter 02: Executing a build by hand.]

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:09,165
So we have the code checked out over here. 

3
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:14,940
So we've got a couple of files.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,022
I know we're going to need
coffeescript and also uglify, 

5
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:23,977
so let's make a package.json
with those things in it.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,474
[Silence]

7
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,234
TS: What will the package.json allow you to do?

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,600
JG: Package.json is what npm
the node packaging system uses.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,217
And one of its functions is
to manage your dependencies.  

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,908
There are two sets of dependencies,
dependencies and dev-dependencies.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,371
Dependencies are things that your
program uses in run time in production, 

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,537
and dev-dependencies are things you use
for testing or examples, or what have you. 

13
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,200
So coffeescript and uglify are
not going to be part of the tool, 

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,051
they're things you can run with the tool.

15
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,565
They'll be part of the examples so I'll put them in dev.

16
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:23,497
TS: OK

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,411
JC: So save that, and if you run
npm install it should install them for you. 

18
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,308
So that's good.

19
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:43,508
Packages that provide executables
npm puts those in `node_modules/.bin`. 

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,222
And they just sit inside the project.

21
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:54,811
So we should be able to compile each
of those things into a javascript file.

22
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:59,874
And then minify them and concatenate the results. 

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,634
So were going to need to do...

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,980
[James thinks]

25
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,610
Let's make another directory inside there and move...

26
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:25,942
Can I do it that way? We'll soon find out.

27
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,940
TS: Looks like it.
JC: Ok so those are in source, we'll make another directory called lib. So I want to run node modules.bin with coffee... I want to compile and put the output in example lib and compile example source with complimenter coffee
