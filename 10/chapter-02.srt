[Chapter 2: Playing a clap sample]

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,112
SP: So this is just an empty
directory: there's nothing here. 

3
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:13,248
I'll start by creating an HTML file,
so we can start doing things.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,144
And I'll just use Vim. [Laughter]

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,912
And I can configure that the way I like.
I don't like decorum when I make things.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:31,552
So the reason I comment something like inaud is because inaud the labels. Everyone says what kind of course is that why inaud.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,208
<head> and [Silence as Sole types]

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,400
So this is just inaud.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,688
[Silence]

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,880
I think I learned this trick from you, how to solve inaud.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,880
DN: Is that utf-8?

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,376
No, this is me typing quickly. I think you can use both.

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,816
inaud the parser knows.

14
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:10,448
Right now I don't need to have anything
but I suppose I should put something for it.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,512
Close everything. Inaud.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:28,416
So if I open this thing – there's nothing here,
just this thing, nothings happening either.

17
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:32,784
To start with it's just the plain clap.

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,520
You can see how I start assembling the whole inaud.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,744
So back to this thing.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,880
I need something that loads, or does
the thing, so I'm going to load a script which...

21
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,040
This is not the best place to
put it but I will start with this. 

22
00:01:55,248 --> 00:02:00,080
And obviously we need to write the file.

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,840
I like to be at least, a little correct. inaud here

24
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:15,488
So the code at least waits for loading.
