00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Chapter 6: Playing part 2 sequence.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,000
So we've got this thing which
is, (sorry control-M)  looping.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,760
But, we might want to have the second player playing.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,560
Because right now it's incomplete!

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,640
So I'm going to mute this thing again.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,300
And so looking at the challenge, it says
that it starts playing both at the same time.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,050
After 4 times of repeating the stanza,
the second player shifts one note?

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,270
DN: Yes.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,900
And then after four times of doing that
thing, the second player shifts another beat.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:48,590
So I want to increase the stanza
number after every 4th repeat. 

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,580
And I'm going to use the stanza
number every time I want to shift. 

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,160
So I'm going to algorithmically
generate the score for the second player. 

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,750
Instead of giving this player a different
score I will look at the score and shift that.

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,550
It's the second score but it's
determined based on the existing score. 

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,070
Because maybe later, if we have time we
might want to change the score. inaud

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,880
That's why I'm not generating that from the
beginning, but basing it on the existing score.

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:36,650
I guess I can have something like stanzaLoopTime... 

18
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,040
No, I don't like this variable here.

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,755
DN: I suppose it's almost like,
how many repetitions in a stanza.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,435
SP: Yeah, stanzaReps. Like power lifters! [Laughter]

21
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:57,965
OK, so we also want to loop
4 times to hard code everything.

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:07,590
I don't know if I want to call it stanza loop.
numStanzaloops maybe, that sounds better.

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,395
DN: OK.

24
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,675
SP: I will say I want to loop this
thing 4 times, and every time it's 4, 

25
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,920
I will just increase the reps and
then decide what way to play it.

26
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,380
Also, we can get rid of this play
sequence because we are reducing the thing.

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,735
Go away.  It's good to leave it clear inaud.

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,660
DN: Yes sure.

29
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,355
SP: So this is when we should repeat
the thing, so this is we need to increase.

30
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,380
We also could get rid of these console thingies. 

31
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:47,280
What else... For example here,
but we will keep it for now. 

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,235
We could use it to print the
number of reps that we've done.

33
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,270
I'll go to the top so I can see.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,100
So stanzaReps. 

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,580
We also want to know which
is the current stanza number.

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:12,295
We want to keep the number
of reps of the current one; maximum of 4. 

37
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,000
But we also need to know which is the
current one so we can increase that after 4 beats.

38
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:18,690
DN: Sure.

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,480
SP: And also make sense inaud this,

40
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,850
So this is the current one. 

41
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,010
This is the amount of time we repeat with the stanza. 

42
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,185
And this is the maximum we repeat the stanza.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,585
I think it's a good idea to have
variables ordered in a logical way. 

44
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,350
So when we finish the sequence, we look but we also... 

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,755
We increment the number
of repetitions of the stanza. 

46
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:51,770
But if the stanza reps is the number of loops, we should increase the current stanza... Hopefully. [laughter]

47
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,770

So I will print current stanza  And maybe the reps as well so we can check it.
DN: Sure.
SP: So this is the current stanza and reps
I don't usually use the word stanza.
DN: It's not slipping off your fingers.
SP: No, it's not. In theory it should stop. Something broke.
[they listen to the clapping]
I'm not sending anything to zero. [laughter] So that's why it's going forever. So it should increase that but it also should... It's hard to think when this thing is clapping in your face.
It should increase that but also go back to zero. Need to inaud because we're doing a new one. OK let's try again.
[They listen again]
I think that makes more sense.
The first one doesn't load because we are not inaud yet., but |I think its correct.
DN: It looked wrong at first there because...
SP: Yes, we should show the thing on the screen all the time because it would make more sense. So I think I will wait until we get the player playing [they listen] This looks good, so I'm going to get the second player to play. I need to commit this in.
I keep checking this, I am only changing main.js.
So this should be "keep track of stanza and reps".
