00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chapter 3: Adding a limiter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,540
This is OK, but sometimes you want
to make sure things don't get too noisy 

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,570
because maybe this sample is super
super saturated. You don't want to deafening.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
So it's a good idea to insertn
a limiter, in the meantime.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,670
So instead of connecting the sample
to the destination, you connect it to the limiter.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,360
So you don't maximize all the sounds.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,350
DN: So you don't blow up your speakers.
SP: Exactly!

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,380
So I will create this thing up
here... Very much a inaud name. 

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:51,310
And I will create another node
which I think is called 'compressor'... 

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,730
DynamicsCompressor.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,520
So instead of connecting to the
destination, I will connect to the limiter.  

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,960
And then I  will connect the limiter to
the destination.  So we create this whole chain. 

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,920
And this is always connected,
so we don't need to do this all the time.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,630
So I will connect this into the limiter.

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,990
and it should still play. [We hear a clap]

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,080
DN: OK.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,980
Its not the format inaud. This is the base here.

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,810
DN: So we're seeing the graph?

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,430
SP: Yes, but we don't see the buffer store
because it's just died and it's been deleted.

20
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,550
DN: I see.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,810
SP: You see now everything has gone
because we're not using it anymore.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,090
DN: The garbage collector is
doing his thing [laughter]. 

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,270
So you saw that very briefly.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,640
DN: A flash of a second.

25
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,120
SP: Well we have more things running.
We will see more things showing up. 

26
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,500
and it's interesting to see that things don't stay.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,720
So that's inaud.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,500
 So when you want to describe things, or when things inaud too long.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 Inaud.
Hmm... Maybe I should check that everything's correct.

 So when you want to describe things, or when things inaud too long.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
DN: I see.
SP: So it's good to keep an eye on these.  If something inaud correctly. We want to make sure things are really disposed of.
DN: Yes.
SP: So we've got this thing but it's just like a clap and we want to play the sequence.
 So when you want to describe things, or when things inaud too long.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,970
 So when you want to describe things, or when things inaud too long.
