Chapter 13: Panning each player left or right.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,731
SP: I did commit this thing.

3
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:10,651
And instead of reverting this thing, I'm going to
reuse this structure I created for the gains.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,285
And instead of changing the volume,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,725
I'm going to make sure that each panning node is on a
different side so each player is on a different side.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,950
The playBuffer() function had the gainIndex and the gainValue.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,411
I don't need the gainValue because
the panning is going to be set.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,337
So I'm going to remove that.

9
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:41,897
So one of the notes will be on
the left or the right, or whatever it is.

10
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:45,211
We don't need this.  

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,251
Instead of gain it should be panNode.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,234
This I don't need.

13
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,005
The structure is pretty much the same.

14
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,400
I could maybe replace all.

15
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:25,680
DN: Is there still a gainNodes somewhere?

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,257
SP: Yes, some gains somewhere
but we know where they are.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,250
This is going to play in the pan zero. We don't care about the values now because they are inaud. This is a terrible function because its clapSamples1, plus some time and one number but you don't know what it is. It's not the best practice but you could elaborate on that later.

I don't like this, like, "magic numbers" thing it's pretty terrible.
Ok so we need to create panNodes instead of gainNodes. I think its panner actually.

There is also a StereoPannerNode, which is the one we want because it's easier to set up.
DN: Ah right.
SP: So this StereoPannerNode just goes left and right with the pan thingy. Whereas the other one is 3D, and you need to set up direction and the listener and also specify the listener. So this one is easier just left and right. So I want to create the stereo panner. And nodes, this is a habit with me.
DN: g... p...
SP: So I connect this thing here. I also need to specify its pan. So p pan value. I need to create a stereo panner, and pan nodes.
DN: is this going to be something  between -1 and +1?
SP: Yes. Yes, -1 is full left, and plus one [full right]...
So how do I do this inaud.
I'm going to be super lazy because we are running out of time.  I'm going to v: allow here if j is zero minus one plus one. Because we are just going to write from zero one to one. Maybe we don't want it to be so specialised because this is extreme left and extreme right, but we will see.
Sometimes you don't want to do it so saturated because if you play it in places that have proper speakers, some people won't listen to that because they are in the wrong place. But I think this should be ok.
So hopefully this should still work. Yes, stereo.
DN: Can you tell?
SP: I can
DN: Yes I can hear it now. From where I'm sitting I'm just getting a wall of sound. Like the inaud from before but...
SP: I'm trying to click on this. Anyway in theory you can see where the property is.
If you could stop it. Now you can see the pan here.
DN: Right
