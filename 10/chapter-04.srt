Chapter 4: Playing part 1 sequence once

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,025
SP: OK, so we want to play this thing, at least once. 

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,580
Let's just make the first player play inaud.

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:11,520
DN: Sure.

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:17,780
So I'm going to copy this
here and add it as a comment. 

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:19,875
Obviously we don't know how to play the thing.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,240
 But I'm going to simulate this as
an array. Make it as zeros and ones.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:27,645
DN: Yes, sure.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,615
SP: So it's one, one, one, and
the score is zero, so it's nothing. 

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,510
Then one, one, one zero, one one, zero, one,
zero, one, one, zero.  So that's the same, but in binary.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,360
DN: Yes, binary solo.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,850
SP: Yes. Sometimes what I do when
you have things that come from strings,

13
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:59,690
because people are comfortable
drawing things, kind of like ASCII art.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,680
You could parse it and say
if it's an x replace it with a one  etc. 

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,100
But, in this case its short enough
for us to leave it like that.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,790
Yes, that should be short enough.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,665
So, we can assume that
every element of the array is a step.

18
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,660
So I will arbitrarily give it a stepLength, say 0.2 seconds. Because web audio uses seconds.  So what I will do initially to play the sequence is calculate timing for all this and schedule the play, so we can reuse the same buffer.
I don't need to load it every time, just load it once and reuse it with different buffer sources.
So instead of playing the buffer, what I'll do is play the sequence. I want to inaud.
Normally my font is very small so I can see everything, but here I can't so I need two panes here.

When it's a long file like this I like to see the top.
So, we can assume that
every element of the array is a step.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,675
So, we can assume that
every element of the array is a step.
