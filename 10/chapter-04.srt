Chapter 4: Playing part 1 sequence once

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,025
SP: OK, so we want to play this thing, at least once.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,580
Let's just make the first player play inaud.

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:11,520
DN: Sure.

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:17,780
So I'm going to copy this
here and add it as a comment.

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:19,875
Obviously we don't know how to play the thing.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,010
But I'm going to simulate this as
an array. Make it as zeros and ones.

8
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:27,640
DN: Yes, sure.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,615
SP: So it's one, one, one, and
the score is zero, so it's nothing.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,510
Then one, one, one zero, one one, zero, one,
zero, one, one, zero.  So that's the same, but in binary.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,360
DN: Yes, binary solo.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,850
SP: Yes. Sometimes what I do when
you have things that come from strings,

13
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:59,690
because people are comfortable
drawing things, kind of like ASCII art.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,680
You could parse it and say
if it's an x replace it with a one  etc.

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,100
But, in this case its short
enough for us to leave it like that.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,790
Yes, that should be short enough.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,615
So, we can assume that
every element of the array is a step.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:29,190
So I will arbitrarily give it a stepLength,
say 0.2 seconds. Because web audio uses seconds. 

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,835
So what I will do to play the sequence initially,

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,966
is calculate the timing for all this
and schedule the play, so we can listen.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
so we can reuse the same buffer

22
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,310
I don't need to load it every time, just load it
once and reuse it with different buffer sources.

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,710
So instead of playing the buffer,
what I'll do is play the sequence.

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,870
So I'll change this.

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,710
With the decodedBuffer... I'll change things later.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,870
I want to inaud up on things that already exist.

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:22,240
[Silence]

28
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,020
It's not behaving so...

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,890
Normally my font is very small
so I can see everything in one go.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,250
But here I can't so I need two panes both in the center.

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340


When it's a long file like this I like to see the top.
So, we can assume that
every element of the array is a step.
