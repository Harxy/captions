Chapter 14: Wrapping up.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,805
DN: OK Sole I think it's time to wrap up, so let's
return to the challenge and see where we are.

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:16,410
SP: I think we are done, or overdone if you want!

4
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:25,760
We are playing all these things and
also making it stop and changing tempo. 

5
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,862
We also added some humanization.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,120
DN: Yes.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,028
SP: And also made it in stereo,
so you don't get a wall of sound.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,240
So that's pretty much done for the time that we have.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,914
DN: As a performance, that ticks all the boxes.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,617
SP: Yes, the only issue is that it
will never stop, it's going to loop forever.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:00,674
If we had more time we could do more
things like detect when we are at the end. 

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,594
Like this is the 12th time, so stop...
Clear the timeout and don't do anything else.

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,245
DN: Sure.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,531
SP: So that's one thing we could do.

15
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:11,280
But you never said you didn't want this to loop.

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,920
DN: No it's not in the spec!

17
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:19,417
SP: So that's one of the things that we could do.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,217
DN: And you have mentioned
a few times that the code is messy. 

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:33,074
If you did have time to polish this up,
what would you do to make the code cleaner.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,108
SP: This thing has caught my
attention. I would remove it. 

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,148
I would make sure that the component
is a bit less. That would be on some other project. 

22
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:51,725
There is nothing else I would do.

23
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:59,040
I would definitely extract
things to other functions. 

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,748
For example this playBuffer doesn't
need to be here because this file is long. 

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:12,080
It's not too long, its 134 lines. But it's
hard to make out what's going on here. 

26
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,617
Things get loaded. 

27
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,560
I would make things into functions
so I can see the sequence of what's going on.

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,480
And more parameters because right
now everything is using a global context.

29
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:29,702
It connects things to things but it's not very neat. 

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,771
I would have the main.js set the sequence
and then extract things into functions.

31
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,160
And because we're using webpack
it's pretty easy to require things 

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,222
instead of having everything in one massive file.

33
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,914
But it's also important not to worry
about requires when your prototyping.

34
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,965
Because then you're like: oh I need
to add this file to git, and then it's a require;

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,942
And it kind of like stops you.

36
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,742
If this was growing more and I was using it
with more people in the project I would  split that 

37
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:09,180
because it's easier to collaborate with people
when every person is touching a different file. 

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,360
But when you're beginning, when you're sketching,
you don't want to be worrying about small details.

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,765
I would just go step by step in this re-factoring.

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,268
I would like to have main be a more
a more general global thing to direct everything

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,765
and make this sequence more obvious.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,222
Because right now we're
having this giant initialization of things 

43
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,950
and then a function in the middle [laughter].
