Chapter 8: Adding a build system.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,480
So... I think we should go back to the challenge. 

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,160
Well we have this, but not the interface.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,470
We don't have play and stop and
there's no way to modify the tempo,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,660
unless we change [the code],
and that's not very dynamic!

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,100
DN: Right, change the code.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,550
SP: Yes, and reload. No! That's not very funny.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,450
So... I am lazy so I'm going to use a
component that renders all those buttons for you.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,360
I just don't want to do this anymore inaud. I suppose it's OK being lazy as a programmer, if you work then you don't have to work again.
DN: That's right.
SP: So I made a component and used it with npm. So I need to initialize this thing as an npm project, first. so I'm going to npm init this thingy. Because that way I'll have a package JSON. Otherwise it stores the thing in `node_packages` folder but it doesn't save the dependencies to packages.json. If I give you this repository and I don't check in the node modules, you're going to have a hard time figuring out what dependencies I'm using.
DN: I see.
SP: So it is important. So I will just... OK fine, then clapping. No text no repo, clap.
In theory I should just press return, but I kind of like writing yes, it gives me the confidence (laughter) I'm not going to mess with something I shouldn't be messing with.
So now I should be able to npm install things.
They are going to be saved as dependencies in packages.json, otherwise if you say `npm install --save` it doesn't really save if there's no package.json.
And I'm not going to create it from scratch because I can't remember.
