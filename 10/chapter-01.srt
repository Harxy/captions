Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,384
where you can hone your skills
by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,448
Our guest today is Soledad Penades,
who is a developer evangelist at Mozilla.

4
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:17,232
She works on the web platform
and developer tools for Firefox.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,680
And she loves to experiment
with Web Audio and Web GL.

6
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm your host, Drew Neil, and the challenge
that I set for Sole is called "Clapping Music".

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,616
[Chapter 1. The challenge].

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,680
DN: OK Sole, do you want
to start by reading the challenge?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,656
SP: Yeah! I'll try to, I'll do my best! 

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,232
Ok, so the challenge is: Create a system that
performs Steve Reich's composition "Clapping Music".

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,408
"Clapping Music" has two parts that
are based on the same rhythmic cell.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,400
 Part 1 plays this rhythmic cell
consistently throughout the piece. 

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,520
(x means play a sound, _ means rest).

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,512
So it's like tatata tata ta tata

15
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:02,750
Part 2 begins by playing this cell
then cycles through11 variations, 

16
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:05,696
each of which is shifted by one beat.

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,152
The system should have some user
interface to play and stop the music,

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,024
as well as providing a way of modifying the tempo.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,880
DN: On this page we've got
a representation of the score.

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:24,576
SP:  Exactly. (Laughter as Sole considers
how difficult it is to represent the sounds by voice).

21
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:30,432
SP: OK, so its tatata tata ta tata, so
on the first line both players are playing the same.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,016
And on the next repeat the first
player is playing the same thing 

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,888
and the second player makes a shift on one side? 

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,136
Or it's like he's one step behind or ahead. 

25
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,072
DN: Yeah... [thoughtfully].

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,192
SP: Actually it's one step ahead, so we
want to add one step to the thingy.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:06,160
SP: It keeps shifting and then at the end
they are playing the same thing again.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:14,256
DN: Yes, that's right. It's a very simple
idea but it's surprisingly engaging.  

29
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:18,832
The music that comes out of it is interesting:
the noises it makes are quite exciting to listen to.

30
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,848
SP: Yes, interesting (laughter).

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,328
 I think it can serve to show a number of techniques because this is very in sync, 

32
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,320
and if things drift you can not totally notice...because ... Repeat one time.. I would say lots of elements.... Or just like garbage collector with like WOW this is a lot of things for me to worry about. So inaud.
