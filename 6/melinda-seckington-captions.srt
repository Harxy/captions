00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,632
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:06,700
where you can hone your
skills by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,168
Our guest today is Melinda Seckington.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,056
She works as a Ruby developer
at FutureLearn, a social learning platform.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,552
Melinda co-organizes BarCamp London,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,030
and participates regularly in
hack days, frequently winning them.

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,968
I'm your host, Drew Neil.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,600
And the challenge that I set for Melinda is called...

9
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,180
Building a Mechanical Turk system.

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,184
DREW NEIL: So Melinda would you like
to start by reading the challenge.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,368
MELINDA SECKINGTON: Build a Mechanical Turk system.

12
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:43,696
It should poll people for answers to yes/no
questions that are easily answered by humans

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,288
but not by machines.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,264
If a certain number of people
give the same answer to a question,

15
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,710
it's marked as resolved and
polling for that question ceases.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,536
If people give different answers to
the same question, then polling will continue

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,480
until a consensus is reached and
that question can be marked as resolved.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,688
When someone has answered a question, they
may view a summary of all answers to that question,.

19
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,670
DN: There's a little bit
more to the question actually.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,192
If you turn to the next page,
I've provided a sample question.

21
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,032
MS: Is this a cat picture?

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,456
DN: So I think most human beings
would have no trouble answering that.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,328
Whereas it would be difficult to write
a program to give the right answer there.

24
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:25,648
With more than 50% certainty.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,736
And there's another question as well.

26
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,824
MS: Is this a squirrel picture?

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,344
I think I can say no.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,872
DN: Right.

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,504
So that's the kind of question I
thought we could be working with here.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,832
I've provided about 6 animal pictures, so
we can come up with a series of yes/no answers.

31
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,144
Sorry, I mean questions where it's a yes/no answer.

32
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,840
Most of them are going to be nonsense,

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,536
but for each picture there
will be one correct answer.

34
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,530
MS: Yes.

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,560
DN: So that's what I thought we'd use as
a sample data set for this challenge.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,720
So, I haven't said which technology
you have to use to build this system.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,352
What would be your preference here?

38
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:20,880
For me it would be Ruby and Rails
because I'm familiar with those already.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,904
Plus we've already got a very simple log in
and log out system so that people can register.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,152
So, basically if we go to the log in page.

41
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:42,072
And hit the register button.

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,096
[Silence]

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,696
Now we're logged in.

44
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,944
DN: So it looks like a brand new rails app.

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,032
MS: Yes.

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,872
[They both talk at once]

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,920
DN: inaudible it already has a red
register route and a log in route.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
So if we go to log in again...

49
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:04,904
You will be redirected to the main
page because you're already logged in.

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,576
DN: So it can detect that
you're logged in, it remembers you.

51
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,248
And, can you log out as well?

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,496
MS: Yes, you just hit log out.

53
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:18,736
Which you can't really see but you
can hit the log in page and log in again.

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,272
So it's very very basic.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,464
DN: Rudimentary... we don't even have passwords.

56
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,424
No its really basic.

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,088
DN: Well that's fine, that's not going to be
an interesting part of this challenge I think.

58
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,304
[New Chapter]

59
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:42,080
MS: So, where to start.  It's a Mechanical
Turk system so we've got people... users.

60
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:49,304
And we want to show each
user the questions that we have.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,560
So let's start with looking
at creating these questions.

62
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:02,080
Each question will have an image.

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,288
That's showing us the cat picture.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,272
Text, I guess, like... is this a cat picture

65
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,856
So I guess let's start there.

66
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,824
[Silence]

67
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,056
Let's take the image.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,040
DN: So the string is going to
be a URL from where it listed it.

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,280
MS: Yes.

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,592
DN: In a public directory probably.

71
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,872
Let's do... description.

72
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:50,304
And string as well, because we don't want that to be too long.

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,912
DN: So the challenge doesn't ask you to create
an admin area where people can create questions,

74
00:04:55,912 --> 00:05:00,360
We're going to pre-populate
the system with some questions?

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,072
MS: Yes.

76
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,016
So we want to...

77
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,016
[Silence]

78
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,904
This can be used inaudible so that we can use db:seed.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,900
So I'll load that in.

80
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,992
So I want to use the seeds inaudible

81
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,888
[Silence]

82
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:29,424
DN: So this is just a plain Ruby file. It will
load the environments and then create models.

83
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,016
MS: Yes.

84
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,496
DN: And then you can
execute this file with a rake task.

85
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,632
MS: Yes.

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,104
Let me just set up our questions.

87
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:48,384
So very simply we want to do question.create.

88
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,384
[Silence]

89
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,736
Inaudible

90
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,744
[Silence]

91
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:09,904
So we have, what did we say
before... image and... description.

92
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:15,528
That would be the very very simple way of inaudible it.

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,832
But we want to do something
a little bit smarter I think.

94
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,632
Let's put the images is somewhere.

95
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,008
DN: Yes, I gave them to you with your challenge,
but I don't think they're in your rails app yet.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,416
MS: No they're not.

97
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:38,528
DN: When I first created these
images, I named them dog.jpg, cat.jpg

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,280
And then I realised that was a little
opinionated so I changed it to 'Animal 1', 'Animal 2'...

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,104
[Melinda thinks]

100
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,704
MS: Yes, let's just throw them in the public.

101
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:56,360
They'll maybe come up in a lesser place later

102
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,368
[Silence]

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,016
How do you loop through numbers again... times.

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,016
[Silence]

105
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,920
I'll double check the inaudible

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,272
It would be Ruby times rather than...

107
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,296
[Silence]

108
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,208
DN: That's a great way of finding
documentation, is that something to do with Alfred.

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,160
MS: Yes so...

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,752
DN: So you've got it searching rails documentation.

111
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,728
MS: Yes, it's a work flow that's called Dev Doctor.

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,696
And it's not just for rails, it's for most
programming language that you can think of.

113
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,216
DN: Oh that's good.

114
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,576
MS: Yes, it's really handy.

115
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,408
Yes I was right.

116
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,488
I have to question myself sometimes.

117
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,504
[Silence]

118
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,976
DN: Oh that's...

119
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:25,056
MS: Yes, sublime, like soup, try to open

120
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,752
DN: A binary file.

121
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:40,960
DN: They could be called Animal-1.jpg, Animal-2...
I guess six times is going to be 0 to 5, isn't it?

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
MS: Yes.

123
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,752
[Silence]

124
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,216
I'm sure we can make this smarter, in the sense that...

125
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:18,584
Well, I guess what we can do here is...

126
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,624
[Silence]

127
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,728
Which animal shall we actually have?

128
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,752
DN: That's a good question.

129
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,648
Hedgehog, Squirrel , Goat...

130
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,736
DN: Yes, let's Goat!

131
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,730
MS: So...

132
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,768
[Silence]

133
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,192
Dog, Cat, Cow...

134
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,056
DN: You're definitely not a
machine, you make that look easy.

135
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,040
[Silence]

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,512
So... I want to do that.

137
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,496
Two times.

138
00:10:55,232 --> 00:11:00,776
So now what we then get is, for every single animal...

139
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,576
Basically for every image we create six questions

140
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,792
asking whether or not it's
all the other animals as well.

141
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,056
DN: OK.

142
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,480
MS: So I think this should work.

143
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,592
DN: So we'll end up with 36.

144
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:20,528
MS: Yes, 36 questions.

145
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,792
DN: Where most of them are wrong answers.

146
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,720
MS: Yes.

147
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:30,288
So let's see...

148
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,848
We'll migrate first because
we haven't done that before.

149
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,928
I only hope that this doesn't blow up.

150
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,992
[Silence]

151
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,032
36, how about that!

152
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,400
And then pluck all the...No, I don't call them URLs image.

153
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,968
We should have 6 of each of them.

154
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,968
[Silence]

155
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,832
DN: Is this a hedgehog, is this a squirrel, goat?

156
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:15,088
MS: And I forgot to put a question mark at the end.

157
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,136
DN: Well you could even hard
code that. It is a question.

158
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,960
DN: I could do that... so let's just delete them all again.

159
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,056
[Silence]

160
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,440
MS: I'll just analyze the question inaudible.

161
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,472
[Silence]

162
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,888
There we go, that's nicer.

163
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,880
DN: That does look nice.

164
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:05,840
It feels like being in a car with a toddler. [laughter]

165
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:16,568
So next up is, we want to display these to a user.

166
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,568
[Melinda thinks]

167
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,144
DN: Is that worth a commit do you think?

168
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,992
MS: Yes, it is, I keep forgetting that.

169
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,408
We've got inaudible, seeds and then a question.

170
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
[Silence]

171
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:48,600
[New Chapter]

172
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:53,424
DN: OK, so we've got the question
model, what do you want to do next?

173
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,928
MS: The next thing is
displaying the questions to users.

174
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:07,872
So we want to, I guess, show the image and the question,

175
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,384
like... is this a hedgehog, is this a squirrel?

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,920
And then maybe not quite yet...

177
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,032
do the logic of allowing a user to answer yes or no.

178
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,816
but maybe creating fake buttons initially,

179
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:32,080
so we just display here's the image,
here's the question, and here are the buttons.

180
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,808
Here I guess we need to figure out,

181
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,400
how does the user get to these?

182
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:44,184
DN:I suppose we could have...

183
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:48,792
when the user logs in the route page
could be a list of questions to begin with,

184
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,312
and each item in the list
would be a link to the question itself.

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,312
MS: Yes, that's probably the easiest way to do it.

186
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,992
OK, hmm...

187
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:07,848
So let's go to our route file and start with that.

188
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,496
So we...

189
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,104
basically we want the route
of the page to be linked to the...

190
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,424
to our questions.

191
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,072
DN: So it's a questions index really.
MS: Yes.

192
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:31,008
And we also want resources as questions.

193
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,776
Well, our questions to resources.

194
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:37,584
and then  I always like doing this...

195
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:44,016
To make sure that we are only
influencing the actions that we are using,

196
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,344
rather than getting all 6 of
them and leaving those in place.

197
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,848
DN: And in any case we don't want the
system to allow you to create questions... not yet.

198
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,504
MS: No, so only the index can show for now.

199
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,528
So let's make our questions controller.

200
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,544
[Silence]

201
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,664
As I said before, we have index...

202
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,368
and show...

203
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:35,104
DN: I notice you use a rails
generator when you're creating a model.

204
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,528
but not when creating a controller... is that normal?

205
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,336
Uhm... [Melinda thinks]

206
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,440
MS: I'm not sure I do that actually.

207
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:50,024
[Melinda thinks again]

208
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,296
Yes, I guess because I know
exactly what comes back when I...

209
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,800
use generate model.

210
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,728
And I always feel that with generate
controller I get more than I want.

211
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:10,984
DN: Yes, it generates the asset
files, inaudible, JavaScripts and so on.

212
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,400
MS: Yes, normally it's like...

213
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:17,680
DN: More inaudible that what you want.
MS Yes.

214
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:21,376
And again I'm guessing there's an easier way

215
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,232
specify which things you exactly
want when you generate the controller.

216
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:31,944
But.. I kind of like having a
bit more control over it myself

217
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:35,744
and being able to see when I'm adding inaudible

218
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,272
DN: Yes, sure.

219
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,728
MS: While with a model you
get the rspec file, the user file and...

220
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,376
[The migration is not meant to be on there]

221
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,248
DN: So the model generator
gives you exactly what you want,

222
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:53,050
and you think the controller
generator gives you too much.

223
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,600
MS: Yes, pretty much. [Laughter]

224
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,150
DN: Yes, I can relate to that.

225
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:02,560
So let's create inaudible for that as well.

226
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,120
So questions.

227
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:10,552
And in here we have...

228
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,352
I'll have to say index.

229
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,368
[Silence]

230
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,800
It won't show.

231
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,976
So...

232
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:37,176
Index is going to grab all
the questions that we have.

233
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,168
[Silence]

234
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,664
Here.

235
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,472
DN: That should be fine.

236
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:55,944
MS: I realise I never use the inaudible
because normally with so much more data...

237
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:59,296
DN: We don't need to patch anything.

238
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,632
[Silence]

239
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:24,288
MS: So let's just show the description first.

240
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:29,944
That should just show up here... No.

241
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,944
[Silence]

242
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
DN: Lovely.

243
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:47,620
MS: All the questions.

244
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,040
So let's make a little nicer.

245
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,064
[Silence]

246
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:16,144
And let's link to...

247
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:22,360
Now what do we call that?

248
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,368
[Silence]

249
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,216
inaudible

250
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,208
[Silence]

251
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,368
So do we want to show the image on this page already?

252
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,848
DN: I think that would get a bit busy.

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,744
Maybe even you shouldn't show the text.

254
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,616
Maybe it should be like, question 1, question 2.

255
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,176
MS: Yes, we could even change it to that.

256
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:01,416
It makes it a bit more serious... what we're going to get.

257
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,440
[Silence]

258
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,088
DN: I guess they have IDs already
don't they which will probably be sequential.

259
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,080
MS: Yes.

260
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,088
[Silence]

261
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:31,816
Yes, they are sequential but
because we did the seed test twice,

262
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:34,536
they're not going to inaudible

263
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,530
DN: That doesn't matter does it?
MS: No.

264
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:41,984
But it might be nicer if
they were, so we can do instead...

265
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:46,600
I'll just change this to...

266
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:50,536
each_with_index

267
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:57,976
It's for the user that we're displaying what
question number it is, showing on the page itself.

268
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,992
[Silence]

269
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,144
Don't want to do it that way.

270
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:08,288
Inaudible

271
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,648
There we go.

272
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,568
DN: That looks good.

273
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,368
And maybe plus 1s that we don't have.

274
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:19,024
DN: Question zero.
MS: Yes.

275
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,408
DN: Question zero "what is your
name", my science teacher always did that.

276
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:27,128
MS: Yes mine didn't. [Laughter]

277
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,488
So, clicking on here won't do
anything because we don't have a show yet.

278
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,648
We have a show, but I think we'll just leave it that way.

279
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,640
DN: Right.

280
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:46,592
MS: So on this page... [Melinda thinks]

281
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,940
Someone who grabbed a question.

282
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,952
[Silence]

283
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:14,480
Let's just inaudible for now, plus the work.

284
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:19,352
Yes, it would if I did that inaudible

285
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:26,904
inaudible the description.

286
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:30,768
Is this a hedgehog.

287
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,552
I must look that up, I always forget.

288
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,584
[Silence]

289
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,664
Image_tag.

290
00:23:58,488 --> 00:23:59,952
And then I can...

291
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,944
[Silence]

292
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:07,120
I'll say that first.

293
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,144
[Silence]

294
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,872
Its not called URL, it's called image.

295
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,376
DN: Ah... Close.

296
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,824
MS: So because we've put it in the public...

297
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,296
DN: Yes, is it assuming that
it's in the assets directory?

298
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,784
MS: Yes, I think it is.

299
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:35,624
So let's move it to the assets directory.

300
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,648
[Silence]

301
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,352
DN: OK.

302
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,064
So this inaudible work because we need to specify...

303
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,096
[Silence]

304
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:07,696
DN: I thought that assumption was built in?

305
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,624
MS: I'm not sure it is.

306
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,696
DN: Would it help to actually look at the
HTML source?

307
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,696
[Silence]

308
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,128
DN: It's missing .jpg.

309
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
MS: Yes, it is.

310
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,072
DN: In fact, did you move the images or
copy them. Are they still in the public directory?

311
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:38,424
MS: I think I might have copied them... yes.

312
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:42,304
DN: Well that's good because
that's where it's looking for them.

313
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,928
MS: So if we change this...

314
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,904
DN: Ah, there's no E.

315
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,496
That's it.

316
00:25:54,624 --> 00:26:00,112
MS: We're not using that at
all but just adding .jpg behind it.

317
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,176
I guess I left that out during the seeds.

318
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:13,520
I didn't actually put that in.

319
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,472
DN: Regenerate them.
MS: Yes.

320
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,470
inaudible

321
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,504
[Silence]

322
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:31,936
Let's delete our previous ones.

323
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,968
[Silence]

324
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,936
DN: Oh, I think you left the quote.

325
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,936
[Silence]

326
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
There we go.

327
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,328
DN: Do you think the image is a bit big?

328
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:03,016
MS: Yes.

329
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,024
I think we could do that with
size. Ah... just width and height.

330
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:16,360
I made use all the images are the same
width, but they do vary slightly in height.

331
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,936
MS: Right, so let's set the width.

332
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,928
[Silence]

333
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,256
300... yes that looks good.

334
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,744
DN: That looks good.

335
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:34,000
MS: Let's clean this up a bit.

336
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,048
[Silence]

337
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,824
[They both speak at once]

338
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,888
[Silence]

339
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:58,310
DN: I guess the form with the yes/no answers would be inaudible.

340
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:04,072
MS: Here at the top let's add
a link back to all the questions.

341
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,088
[Silence]

342
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,776
DN: OK.

343
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,770
MS: There we go.

344
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,800
[Silence]

345
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:32,896
DN: I'm sure some of them are [laughter].

346
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:36,752
Is that a good place to check in do you think?

347
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,750
MS: Yes.

348
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:49,256
So we don't actually need these,
because in the end we did just find it.

349
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,296
[Silence]

350
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:03,200
So allow users to see questions.

351
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,208
[Silence]

352
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,208
[New Chapter]

353
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:15,504
DN: So I guess next we have the yes/no to do.

354
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:22,648
Would that be a yes button and a no button,
or would it be a radio button with yes and no inaudible?

355
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,472
[Melinda thinks]

356
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,320
MS: I think a radio button would be nicer.

357
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:37,904
How do we do that again? [laughter] Let's have a look.

358
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:40,496
inaudible

359
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,504
[Silence]

360
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,488
DN: Now there's a thought, what is it a form for?

361
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
When we submit this form
what actually happens in the system.

362
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,616
MS: Yes, so we haven't really looked at that yet.

363
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:36,832
But, I'm thinking we basically want a new
level that lies between the questions and the users.

364
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:44,360
We could call it user
questions but that seems wrong.

365
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:46,880
But, maybe just answers.

366
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,496
So an answers model that
belongs to a user and to a question.

367
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,120
Let's leave that form for now.

368
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,864
[Melinda thinks]

369
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,056
So rails join...

370
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,000
This doesn't actually show anything.

371
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,032
[Silence]

372
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:35,592
Its weird, I know what I'm looking for
but I don't know what words I'm looking for.

373
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:47,200
Is there a through keyword that you can use on, like...

374
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:54,360
to join the users to the
questions through the join table?

375
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,384
[Silence]

376
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:02,690
That's maybe through.

377
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,712
[Silence]

378
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,824
DN: So in our case, appointments is like an answer,

379
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:23,544
physicians and patients are
like users and questions, in a sense.

380
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,120
MS: Yes.

381
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes, they are. [laughter]

382
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,664
I normally use the generate function to create this...

383
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:53,880
So we want announcer to have...

384
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,728
A inaudible value for yes or no.

385
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,784
DN: Can we call it response perhaps.
MS: Yes, that's a good idea.

386
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,808
[Silence]

387
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:21,648
And then we want it to belong to both
the questions and to the (other one)...users.

388
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,248
DN: Do you want that comma?

389
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,496
MS: No you don't.

390
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,512
[Silence]

391
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,592
DN: I think if you do user, colon, reference...

392
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,608
[Silence]

393
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,744
Or it might be references, I don't quite remember.

394
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,752
[Silence]

395
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
MS: Yes, I just realised.

396
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,856
[Silence]

397
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,808
So we had a response, we have...

398
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:22,776
the relationship to the user and the
question, and we don't' need anything else, right?

399
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,864
DN: No, that looks good.

400
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,872
[Silence]

401
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,520
Right so... your answer
belongs to a user and a question.

402
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,128
So we just want to have...

403
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:51,360
answers...

404
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,384
[Silence]

405
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:05,776
Questions through answers,
but also has any answers.

406
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,800
DN: Right.

407
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,816
[Silence]

408
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,568
See how many progressions this has.

409
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,584
[Silence]

410
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,264
And the answers this has... many.

411
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:26,912
Users...

412
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,968
[Silence]

413
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,280
DN: That looks good.

414
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:46,944
MS: So we now have that model.

415
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,072
DN: Is that worth a commit do you think?

416
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,656
Or is it not worth a commit?

417
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,184
MS: Ah... maybe.

418
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:03,192
Yes, I think it is, its fallen off, but...

419
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,192
[Silence]

420
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:20,328
[New Chapter]

421
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,896
MS: Right, so I guess that next
up is allowing users to click yes or no,

422
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:31,568
and then recording their response.

423
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:38,670
[Melinda thinks]

424
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:44,608
To do this nicely we need...

425
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:48,088
one is an answers controller.

426
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,376
DN: Right.

427
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,680
MS: Which... all it does is create...

428
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,504
[well records], the yes or no answer.

429
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,432
So we can...

430
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:11,400
So... basically we want our answers to be...

431
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,416
[Silence]

432
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm trying to think what is
the best way of modeling this.

433
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:24,528
DN: If it was a nested resource,
then the URL for...

434
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,064
Say you post to create an answer...
MS: ...it would contain the question

435
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:36,600
And we also know who the user
is, because they're logged in.

436
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,376
So we can grab that from there.

437
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,408
[Silence]

438
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,192
So we only want new and create.

439
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,800
Maybe not even new,

440
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,488
Because we're not really displaying anything.

441
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,936
[Melinda thinks]

442
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:19,128
So let's create our... answers_controller.

443
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,184
[Silence]

444
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,696
What are we trying to do...
have our show... so here we need to add...

445
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:54,344
a form for... an answer.

446
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:59,416
So here we need to create...

447
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,488
[Silence]

448
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,176
Answer from you.

449
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,352
[Melinda thinks]

450
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,856
So I want to do something similar...

451
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,864
[Silence]

452
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:45,632
I'm not completely sure about that anymore.

453
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,696
[Silence]

454
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,392
So question answers...

455
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,408
[Silence]

456
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,392
Alright, and then we wanted the...

457
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,680
radio button tag.

458
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:19,088
[Melinda looks for the radio button]

459
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:21,256
I'm pretty sure...

460
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,280
[Silence]

461
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:32,520
That's actually under public license... rails

462
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:37,552
form for radio buttons app.

463
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,568
[Silence]

464
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,784
DN: I suppose what we really want is add...
I suppose one is true and one is false,

465
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,096
It's inaudible that we say anything else, but the labels can say yes or no.

466
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:10,288
MS: Yes, so basically something like that.

467
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:16,224
So we want a radio button first.

468
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:22,616
Which... response, true.

469
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:27,112
And then a label for it.

470
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,112
[Silence]

471
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:49,944
False...

472
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,504
No.

473
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,552
So I think that should work... No it doesn't.

474
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,832
Oh... my inaudible.

475
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,832
[Silence]

476
00:42:19,048 --> 00:42:20,920
DN: Right.

477
00:42:23,288 --> 00:42:25,790
That looks nice.
MS: Yes.

478
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:34,144
But we can't do anything with it
yet, we've got to add the submit button.

479
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,160
[Silence]

480
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:47,232
DN: It's interesting that the default inaudible by the text.

481
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,728
It sort of makes sense in this case.

482
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,168
MS: Yes, but we can change it.

483
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,592
No we cant, not like that.

484
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,720
DN: I think the comma may be needed.

485
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:03,064
MS: Yes.

486
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,664
Let's have a look, Oh yes it is.

487
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:08,832
DN: OK.

488
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:12,616
So is it hitting the right controller?

489
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:17,064
MS: Yes, it is.

490
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:19,060
DN: That looks good.

491
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,024
MS: We haven't actually put
anything in the controller yet.

492
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,216
So we have answer.

493
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,224
[Silence]

494
00:43:46,504 --> 00:43:48,896
So we require an answer.

495
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:54,920
And that should have a...

496
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,208
response.

497
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,184
[Silence]

498
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,832
DN: Don't you just pass in answer_params?

499
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:17,592
MS: Yes... Oh because we...

500
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,632
And then we inaudible

501
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:26,990
[Silence]

502
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,590
I'm not sure that would be inaudible.

503
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:29,800
[Silence]
I'm not sure that would be inaudible.

504
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,792
[Silence]

505
00:44:34,928 --> 00:44:41,936
DN: So the user is known by the system,
but it's not created in the format at the moment is it?

506
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,930
MS: No, the question will be.

507
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:50,224
DN: I suppose you could put the
user ID in as a hidden field in the form.

508
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,664
And then it could be treated like the other fields.

509
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:57,168
MS: Yes, we can.

510
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:06,400
[Silence]

511
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:08,688
So just hidden_field_tag... yes it is.

512
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:18,648
[Silence]

513
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,632
DN: There's a thought... do we have a current user?

514
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,592
MS: I'm not sure.

515
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,128
I don't think we do.

516
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,752
DN: We have a logged in method
but not a current user method.

517
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:38,480
MS: No, so let's create that.

518
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:55,912
[Silence]

519
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,848
inaudible and session.

[Silence]

521
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:08,072
MS: That should work.

522
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:29,648
[Silence]

523
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:31,920
DN: Answer, that's interesting.

524
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,288
[Silence]

525
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,136
So they've all got inaudible.

526
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:44,656
DN: User is empty, and response is true
which is good because you clicked yes.

527
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,312
MS: And the question ID is right.

528
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:51,912
But somehow...

529
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:56,328
DN: Maybe it's because... when you call radio button tag...

530
00:46:57,328 --> 00:47:00,264
it doesn't put it inside of a form object does it?

531
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,024
Whereas if you put f.radio button...

532
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:21,624
[Silence]

533
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:26,224
DN: Instead of radio button tag,
I think you can just say radio button.

534
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:41,456
[Silence]

535
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:46,792
MS: Oh actually, we were calling that anyway.

536
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,824
[Melinda thinks]

537
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,144
So current user.

538
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:14,416
[Silence]

539
00:48:14,496 --> 00:48:16,776
DN: Couldn't find user with ID.

540
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,672
[Silence]

541
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:23,040
DN: Are we actually logged in at the moment?

542
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:28,376
MS: I thought we were.

543
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:33,024
No we're not, that explains it.

544
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:44,136
[Silence]

545
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:47,256
DN: I wonder, should the hidden field be user ID?

546
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:50,848
MS: Yes.

547
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,048
That's most probably better.

548
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:13,192
[Silence]

549
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:15,832
I think there's something wrong here.

550
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:33,000
[Silence]

551
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,504
DN: What is it calling merge anyway?

552
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:40,960
We're up to 73.

553
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:46,464
MS: Well that's because...

554
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:50,736
that's the only pre answer it has.

555
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:54,904
But, I'm going to find...

556
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:10,128
[Silence]

557
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:12,896
So our ID is 2.

558
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:19,176
So let's actually just try to...

559
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:23,528
[Silence]

560
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:29,840
look if we can get the current
user ID. Does that part even work?

561
00:50:33,816 --> 00:50:37,440
So it finds current user ID.

562
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:40,736
DN: So it is finding that OK?
MS: Yes.

563
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:49,360
DN: I wonder, what if we were
to hard code hidden field to user 2.

564
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:53,528
[Silence]

565
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,552
DN: So it's not a problem
with current user method is it?

566
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:02,240
It's something about the
way we're calling hidden field.

567
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,368
Should it be user ID rather than user?

568
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,432
MS: But we tried that... even that.

569
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,240
So there's something...

570
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,400
[Silence]

571
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:24,928
for and inaudible

572
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:32,888
[Silence]

573
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:35,936
So it was a form for that we're using.

574
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:48,856
[Silence]

575
00:51:49,184 --> 00:51:51,880
DN: Do we need to say value?

576
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,768
MS: Yes.

577
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:10,416
[Silence]

578
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:15,024
So now feed it 'yes'.

579
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,600
DN: Excellent, so finally
we are hitting out controller.

580
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:30,368
MS: Yes, and then in the controller, we don't need that,

581
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:37,920
because we've got question ID and user ID.

582
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:46,776
[Silence]

583
00:52:46,952 --> 00:52:49,344
So where's that inaudible create?

584
00:52:52,392 --> 00:52:54,520
Inaudible that.

585
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:04,448
[Silence]

586
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,440
I think that works.

587
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,144
Oh, they're there because we
don't have a template inaudible

588
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,448
If not inaudible.

589
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:19,488
DN: Excellent.

590
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:23,240
MS: Sort of, except the question ID.

591
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,464
DN: But the response is nil and the user ID is nil.

592
00:53:27,048 --> 00:53:30,504
DN: So something is not matching up there.

593
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,304
[Silence]

594
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,064
MS: So why would it only set the question ID?

595
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,736
[Silence]

596
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:51,000
DN: You know how before
you had params.require_answer?

597
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:54,600
And then you kept it require answer.

598
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:56,880
I didn't quite follow why you did that.

599
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:03,360
MS: That was because, looking at the params,

600
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,864
it didn't seem as if answer was actually being inaudible.

601
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:14,056
DN: But then you also changed
the form, and got rid of... what was it...

602
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:19,056
it was, some of the parameters were
inside a create object, weren't they?

603
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,120
If you got rid of 'as created' there...

604
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:25,720
MS: OK yes.

605
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:27,336
DN: Ah, that did work.

606
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:27,752
MS: Yes,

607
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,088
DN:  Ah, the question ID is nil.

608
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,280
MS: Yes.

609
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,280
DN: Oh that's fine.

610
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:43,528
So the question ID is coming from the
URL, so it's not scoped inside of the answer.

611
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:48,696
MS: So the other way of doing
it is adding another hidden field.

612
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,864
DN: Ah, well now you will have to do that.

613
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:57,584
MS: I'm sure there's a neater
way of doing this, but for now...

614
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,192
[Silence]

615
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:09,024
So let's delete the ones that we have so far.

616
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,448
[Silence]

617
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,008
So now I say yes and submit.

618
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:21,032
[Silence]

619
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,216
So now it's all set.

620
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:26,210
DN: Ah, excellent.

621
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,504
MS: Now... we still don't show anything.

622
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:41,152
So... at the end of this let's redirect... back to...

623
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:47,664
DN: Where did we end up...
well I guess we could just go back to the...

624
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:50,968
page for the question we just answered.

625
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,848
But this time instead of showing
a form [they both talk together].

626
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,200
all answers to that question so far.

627
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,790
MS: Yes, so that's...

628
00:56:03,224 --> 00:56:06,424
That's question path.

629
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,568
[Silence]

630
00:56:15,552 --> 00:56:17,808
Let's go back here.

631
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,304
DN: That's probably worth committing isn't it?

632
00:56:23,488 --> 00:56:28,976
MS: Almost, I have another thing just here with...

633
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:32,296
If you haven't, or maybe not...

634
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:38,592
I was thinking... if you have already
answered the question, don't show the form.

635
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:41,744
DN: Maybe we could do that in the next commit.

636
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,536
[Silence]

637
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:51,352
MS: So what have we done
here... we're basically allowing

638
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,720
[Silence]

639
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:00,328
Allow user to answer questions.

640
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:06,232
[New Chapter]

641
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:12,032
DN: So we've now got the ability to answer a question.
MS Yes.

642
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,136
How about we now tackle
the part of the challenge where

643
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:22,960
if you answered a question, you can view a
summary of all the responses to that question.

644
00:57:22,976 --> 00:57:29,344
MS: Yes, so basically we've already answered
this and we don't want to display it anymore.

645
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:36,240
So let's add a inaudible statement here.

646
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,840
So here...

647
00:57:42,848 --> 00:57:45,696
[Silence]

648
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:55,640
rather than saying .new let's do a find_or_create.

649
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:58,776
[Silence]

650
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:09,112
So where user is the current user.

651
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:18,592
and question...

652
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,712
[silence]

653
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,640
I think this should work.

654
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:32,792
DN: Right, so if the user hasn't answered
this question then it will generate a new one.

655
00:58:32,816 --> 00:58:33,368
MS: Yes.

656
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:38,784
DN: In which all fields will be empty...
apart from user and question.

657
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,824
I guess the response field will be empty.

658
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,104
MS: Yes, and the response field
is the one we care about right now.

659
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:52,840
DN: Whereas if it can find one, the response
field will be true or false, rather than nil.

660
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,760
MS: Yes.

661
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:04,272
So now if we do answer.response.present.

662
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:08,136
inaudible nope.

663
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:13,176
DN: Ah, there's no find or create.

664
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:19,464
[Silence]

665
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:21,460
MS: Create by.

666
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,496
[Silence]

667
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,016
There we go.

668
00:59:33,712 --> 00:59:35,664
DN: Ah excellent.

669
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,568
MS: Well no because we already answered this.

670
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,344
DN: inaudible branch of the 'if'.

671
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:48,640
So we're asking, "if present" and...

672
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,664
MS: Then we're showing a form for actually...

673
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,504
MS: So in that case... yes.

674
00:59:56,848 --> 01:00:00,072
DN: So in there we should have some kind of a summary.

675
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,432
[Silence]

676
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:10,424
MS: Yeah...

677
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,744
Let's make this nicer and do here...

678
01:00:15,832 --> 01:00:18,856
[Silence]

679
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,792
DN: Right.

680
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,840
[Silence]

681
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,048
MS: I have a feeling one or
two or these are... that one, yes.

682
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,928
DN: Because its a method call isn't it... a macro.

683
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,896
[Silence]

684
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:40,312
DN: Nice.

685
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,464
MS: Yes, what do you want to
show here, a summary of what's been...

686
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:50,936
DN: I was thinking it could be...

687
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,408
Let's say the system has 100 users and
80 of them have answered this question,

688
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,856
It could be something like,
79 people said yes and 1 person said no,

689
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,944
[Drew thinks]

690
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,280
Or it could be a percentage
rather than actual numbers...

691
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,096
MS: Yes, well we could play
around with that a bit I guess.

692
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,192
So let's create...

693
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,192
[Silence]

694
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,232
I am not happy with the names, but they can do for now.

695
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:39,272
[Silence]

696
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,800
We'll do this on the where line first.

697
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:11,976
So our questions...

698
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:15,592
Let's do our first one.

699
01:03:15,624 --> 01:03:18,440
[Silence]

700
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:29,016
So I should have one answer...
two answers, two times true.

701
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,016

702
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:42,248
DN: Ah... that's nice.

703
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,880
MS: And then false.

704
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,792
[Silence]

705
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,736
The only problem with this is we
don't know what the question is.

706
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:04,656
inaudible extracts.

707
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,664
[Silence]

708
01:04:37,488 --> 01:04:39,448
DN: Oh I see.

709
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,456
MS: It's not the most optimal
because it keeps on doing this.

710
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:47,224
Yes, we can actually...

711
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:49,808
DN: Ah yes, memoize it.

712
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,488
MS: Yes.

713
01:04:53,368 --> 01:04:54,808
DN: Alright.

714
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,776
[Silence]

715
01:04:59,192 --> 01:05:01,256
MS: Inaudible

716
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,520
So now we have...

717
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,496
DN: I spotted another one on line 5 there.

718
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,168
MS: Yes...

719
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,536
Responses_count.

720
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,512
[Silence]

721
01:05:24,144 --> 01:05:25,920
So we have 2 and zero.

722
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,680
DN: Two nil. [laughter]

723
01:05:29,432 --> 01:05:31,960
Let's just inaudible a little bit.

724
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,832
[Silence]

725
01:05:53,552 --> 01:05:55,360
DN: It looks good.

726
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,752
MS: Simple, but...

727
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:02,032
DN: Is that worth a commit do you think?

728
01:06:03,112 --> 01:06:06,784
MS: Yes, certainly, it's not a big commit but...

729
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,824
[Silence]

730
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,344
[New Chapter]

731
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:28,888
DN: So how about we go back to the
question and look at what we've still got to cover.

732
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:36,080
MS: So we've got the first bit,
allowing people to answer yes or no.

733
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:41,224
And we've got the last bit where we see
the summary of how people have answered.

734
01:06:41,224 --> 01:06:46,696
We're missing the middle bit
where questions get reserved

735
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:50,512
after a certain amount of answers.

736
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:58,224
DN: Yes, the way I phrased that,
it was to give you the chance

737
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:02,120
to suggest how we might implement that.

738
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,160
So let's talk through some scenarios.

739
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:10,120
MS: I guess the most basic one
is just to have a threshold of

740
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,384
the number of people that we want to have answered.

741
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:17,424
So it could be as simple as...

742
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,488
If 10 people answered this question,

743
01:07:19,496 --> 01:07:23,560
it doesn't matter what they
answered, the question is resolved.

744
01:07:24,928 --> 01:07:28,584
But what you might get then is that
5 people said yes and 5 people said no.

745
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:32,448
And that's not really a satisfying answer.

746
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,296
DN: Not a consensus.

747
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:35,290
MS: Yes.

748
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:45,600
So one step further would be to look
at when has the majority answered the same answer.

749
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
DN: Yes.

750
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,440
MS: One way of doing that is...

751
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:58,890
Maybe still using a fresh hole so we at
least have a certain amount of people answering.

752
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,504
Maybe 20.

753
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:02,360
DN: OK.

754
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,952
MS: So let's say we need to have at least 20 answers.

755
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,816
Of which 90% need to be the same.

756
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,928
DN: Yes, I'm not well versed in
statistics but to me that sounds good.

757
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,832
MS: [laughter] good enough for this type of system yes.

758
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:23,848
Erm... yeah.

759
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,312
So how do we want to do this?

760
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:37,088
DN: So if we were to say a
threshold, as you say, it could be 20

761
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:41,000
Or, since we don't have much
data to play with, it could be 3.

762
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,592
MS: Yes.

763
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,208
DN: Where would you store the threshold?

764
01:08:46,096 --> 01:08:51,440
So that would be, I think, in
a constant in the question class.

765
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,984
MS: So...

766
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,744
[Silence]

767
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:13,304
DN: And given a question, it would be
nice to say "how many questions do you have".

768
01:09:13,456 --> 01:09:18,312
Or, more simply, "have you
reached the threshold of answers?"

769
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:21,328
[Silence]

770
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,680
MS: So...

771
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,768
[Silence]

772
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:38,976
count is...

773
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:41,928
[Silence]

774
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:45,776
DN: OK.

775
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:48,112
MS: Yes, really simple.

776
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,448
So now we've got...

777
01:09:53,016 --> 01:09:55,536
inaudible we want to do resolved.

778
01:09:58,312 --> 01:10:02,992
And in that case threshold would have to be reached.

779
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,312
And maybe majority answered.

780
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,832
DN: Majority agreed... that's nice.

781
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:15,952
[Silence]

782
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,680
MS: I can't spell!

783
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:23,560
Yes what's the calculation we want to do here?

784
01:10:23,768 --> 01:10:30,216
DN: It's a majority of either
90% said yes, or 90% said no isn't it?

785
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:31,200
MS: Yes.

786
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,152
DN: Both can be true, the case.

787
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,352
MS: Yes, so calculating both I guess.

788
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:45,232
So, we have total=answers.count.

789
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:53,368
And then we've got yes_percentage.

790
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:58,968
As I said before, I'm not very good at naming things.

791
01:10:59,576 --> 01:11:01,632
So that's...

792
01:11:04,256 --> 01:11:06,400
Let's take a step in-between.

793
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,088
So we have yes_total.

794
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,072
[Silence]

795
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:19,704
DN: Right.

796
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,776
[Silence]

797
01:11:26,584 --> 01:11:32,768
MS: Normally I would extract these
and put them in scopes, most probably.

798
01:11:33,768 --> 01:11:35,384
But for now...

799
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:40,000
So yes_percentage is yes.

800
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,816
Total divided by total.

801
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,112
And the same for no.

802
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:57,416
DN: And for the percentage we need
to multiply by 100 as well don't we?

803
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:00,664
MS: Yes.

804
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:09,224
This is the point where I'm wondering
how do we deal with these type of numbers.

805
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,800
I think I might want to do that.

806
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,752
DN: Or is it 2f.

807
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,400
MS: Yes.

808
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,576
I'm really blanking today. [Laughter]

809
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:25,568
[Silence]

810
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,576
So then if...

811
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,472
[Silence]

812
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:37,808
Greater than... 90.

813
01:12:37,944 --> 01:12:40,920
[Silence]

814
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:48,520
DN: Another way of saying that
is yes percentage is greater than 90

815
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,048
or yes percentage is less than 10.

816
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:54,056
But, let's go with it.

817
01:12:54,056 --> 01:12:56,050
MS: Yes, true.

818
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:03,816
DN: Shall we play around with
that on the consul and see what works?

819
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:09,880
MS: Yes, our last question
had two answers so that should...

820
01:13:11,584 --> 01:13:15,416
DN: Do you need to reload or does
that stuff get reloaded automatically?

821
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,632
MS: Yes.

822
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,688
[Silence]

823
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,408
MS: I knew it... it blew up.

824
01:13:24,648 --> 01:13:27,312
DN: Does reload throw away your instance variables?

825
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,288
MS: No.
DN: OK.

826
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,344
[Silence]

827
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,336
MS: So the nos are not resolved.

828
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:47,360
[Silence]

829
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:54,920
DN: False.

830
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,120
Right, so we've got two answers.

831
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,328
MS: Yes.

832
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,880
DN: That's funny because I thought
both answers were yes, weren't they?

833
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:08,980
MS: Yes, but we need to have at least 20 answers.

834
01:14:09,048 --> 01:14:13,408
DN: But you did threshold reached.
I thought you did majority agreed.

835
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:18,568
MS: I did resolved and then
I looked at majority agreed.

836
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,360
Oh right, we did do majority agreed.

837
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,424
[Silence]

838
01:14:28,152 --> 01:14:30,608
Let's just do a...

839
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,544
[Silence]

840
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,808
That's the wrong number.

841
01:14:55,128 --> 01:15:00,136
DN: Where we working with the first question
previously, rather than the last question?

842
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:03,224
I think the first question is
the one that has responses.

843
01:15:03,552 --> 01:15:05,600
MS: Oh, yes.

844
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:10,408
DN: Ah, there we go.

845
01:15:12,504 --> 01:15:15,072
So the majority agreed is not robust at the moment.

846
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,896
If it has no answers it blows up.
MS: Yes.

847
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:20,600
DN: But that's OK.

848
01:15:21,536 --> 01:15:24,688
Well, we're running out of
time here, so unfortunately,

849
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,824
so we are not going to have
time to build a user interface for this.

850
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,992
But it's been interesting watching
you just play around with the console.

851
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:38,888
[New Chapter}

852
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:45,580
DN: So if you had more time, what's the
next thing you would do with this system?

853
01:15:46,432 --> 01:15:49,570
MS: I guess the next thing would be to actually...

854
01:15:49,824 --> 01:15:54,400
use what we've just done here
with resolving questions.

855
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:57,184
Putting in the interface...

856
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,224
and then beyond that...

857
01:16:01,352 --> 01:16:06,520
doing something a bit smarter about
how we're displaying the questions to users.

858
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,080
Because right now we're just
showing all the questions in a list.

859
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:14,616
It would be a bit nicer if, the
user logged on to the system

860
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,192
and they get shown a random image.

861
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,880
DN: OK, so people don't see them in the same order,

862
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,576
in which case you have question 1 having
loads of answers and later ones having fewer.

863
01:16:23,816 --> 01:16:30,832
MS: And maybe doing something smarter like
showing the questions that don't have many answers,

864
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:38,320
so you can boost the ones that need more answers.

865
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,792
DN: So it would be nice to have
a way to ask the question model

866
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:47,376
"Which of your records needs the next answer?"

867
01:16:47,456 --> 01:16:54,096
And maybe recognizing that the current
user shouldn't answer the same question twice.

868
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,312
That's something you would have to think about.

869
01:16:56,328 --> 01:16:57,272
MS: Exactly.

870
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:03,136
DN: And once you've got that you can
answer a question and ask for the next question.

871
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:07,256
And it will pick one randomly
for you, that would be nice.

872
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,792
MS: Yes, that would be cool.

873
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,288
DN: OK, well thanks very
much for coming on the show Melinda,

874
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:13,592
