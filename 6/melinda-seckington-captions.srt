00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,632
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:06,700
where you can hone your
skills by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,168
Our guest today is Melinda Seckington,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,056
She works as a Ruby developer
at FutureLearn, a social learning platform.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,552
Melinda co-organizes BarCap London,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,030
and participates regularly in
hack days, frequently winning them.

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,968
I'm your host, Drew Neil.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,600
And the challenge that I set for Melinda is called...

9
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,180
Building a Mechanical Turk system.

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,184
DREW NEIL: So Melinda would you like
to start by reading the challenge.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,368
MELINDA SECKINGTON: Build a Mechanical Turk system.

12
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:43,696
It should poll people for answers to yes/no
questions that are easily answered by humans 

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,288
but not by machines.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,264
If a certain number of people
give the same answer to a question,

15
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,710
it's marked as resolved and
polling for that question ceases.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,536
If people give different answers to
the same question, then polling will continue

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,480
until a consensus is reached and
that question can be marked as resolved.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,688
When someone has answered a question, they
may view a summary of all answers to that question,.

19
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,670
DN: There's a little bit
more to the question actually.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,192
If you turn to the next page,
I've provided a sample question.

21
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,032
MS: Is this a cat picture?

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,456
DN: So I think most human beings
would have no trouble answering that

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,328
Whereas it would be difficult to write
a program to give the right answer there.

24
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:25,648
With more than 50% certainty.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,736
And there's another question as well.

26
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,824
MS: Is this a squirrel picture?

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,344
I think I can say no.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,872
DN: Right.

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,504
So that's the kind of question I
thought we could be working with here.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,832
I've provided about 6 animal pictures, so
we can come up with a series of yes/no answers.

31
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,144
Sorry, I mean questions where it's a yes/no answer.

32
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,840
Most of them are going to be nonsense,

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,536
but for each picture there
will be one correct answer.

34
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,530
MS: Yes.

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,560
DN: So that's what I thought we'd use as
a sample data set for this challenge.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,720
So, I haven't said which technology
you have to use to build this system.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,352
What would be your preference here?
