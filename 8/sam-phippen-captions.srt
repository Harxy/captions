00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,777
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:02,777 --> 00:00:06,770
where you can hone your skills
by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:09,245
Our guest today is Sam Phippen

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,228
Who's a swashbuckling hacker from London, UK.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,754
He fixes every size of data problem and inaud plausible solutions.

6
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:22,240
He helps fight the forces of justice
as a member of RSpec core team.

7
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:25,280
And he's sad that he can't hug every cat.

8
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,400
Our host is Camille Baldock.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,017
And the challenge that she's set for Sam is called

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,228
Building a Spy library.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,880
CAMILLE BALLDOCK; So Sam, do you
want to start by reading the challenge?

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,851
SAM PHIPPEN: Sure.

13
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:42,640
Write a simple library to enable testing with spies.

14
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,628
Here's a simple Ruby app
which interacts with a RESTful API.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,308
The app has a passing test suite, but the tests
are an incomplete specification of its behaviour.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,525
Add a set of isolated tests that
spy on collaborations between objects

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,205
to complete the test suite.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,548
Chapter 01

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:07,588
CB: Right! So do you want to have a
quick look at what this Ruby app is and does.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,388
And we can have a play with that
before we actually dive into the challenge.

21
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:13,020
SP: Sure... so...

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,594
It looks like we've got a gem file and a jem file.block
