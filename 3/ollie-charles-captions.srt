NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,245
where you can hone your
skills by watching live coding videos

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,097
Our guest today is Ollie Charles

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,245
who's a Haskell developer at Fynder

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,897
and the author of 24 days of Hackage.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,571
Our host is Steve Purcell

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,314
and the challenge that we set for Ollie is called:

8
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:23,640
Solving Word Chain Puzzles.

9
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,354
Steve Purcell: So Ollie would you like to start

10
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:28,190
by reading through the question description?

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,897
Ollie Charles: So it's write a
program that solves word chain puzzles.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,314
A word chain puzzle starts with
one word and ends with another.

13
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:38,754
Successive entries in the
chain must all be real words.

14
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:42,160
And each can differ from the
previous word by just one letter.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,748
For example, you can get from
"dog to "cat" using the following chain:

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,594
Dog to cog to cot to cat.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,628
Your program should accept
start and end words and a dictionary,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,491
and find word chains between them.

19
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:58,310
OC: So that seems pretty straightforward to me.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,450
I guess that we've got a restriction there,

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,314
that the start and the end words
will have to be the same length?

22
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,051
SP: Yes they will.

23
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,937
OC: You've given me this dictionary as well.

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,382
And I see that some of these are different case.

25
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,170
Is that going to have any impact on the problem?

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,074
Do I need to preserve case
or or lower case everything?

27
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:30,290
SP: I'd like the resulting chain to include
the original case of the word from this file.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,577
And if you ask for a chain between two particular
words they should be present with the same case

29
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,582
in the word list file, in order to be considered valid.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,800
OC: OK.  And is changing case
going to be considered an operation?

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,685
So if I have something that starts with a lower
case A and an upper case A is that a difference of one?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,182
SP: I think so, I think a word will
either be capitalized or not in the dictionary.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,011
I don't think you would find the same
word in there twice, once capitalized and once not.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
OC: OK, Yes. Well, I suppose we'll see what happens.

35
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:19,462
The first thing to do is get my environment set up.

36
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,262
I want to have a Cabal file so
I'll treat this like a proper project.

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,502
I'm going to be using nix  shell to
work with that cabal file to do builds

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,177
and bring down dependencies and stuff like that.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,434
OC: So I've got a terminal here,
I should be able to run cabal init

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,360
So let's call this Word Puzzle.

41
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:48,617
It doesn't really matter about the
version and I'll just use another license.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,594
I'll leave that blank... and all this blank.

43
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,371
SP: Yes it will probably become executable

44
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:07,200
OC: And we'll go with WordPuzzle.hs as the main part.

45
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:21,840
So now I believe I have my cabal file
so I should be able to do some basic builds now.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,491
OC: I'm using the Emacs compile command
there to use the cabal file and do a build.

47
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,902
I'm just going to see if that compiles.

48
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:42,422
Hopefully it's configuring.

49
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:45,028
And it looks like we've got something.

50
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:49,257
I'm going to have to rename this to main.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,634
OK, so that seems to be happy
compiling and stuff like that

52
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:05,291
and we can also switch over
to the terminal and run that... yes.

53
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,062
OC: I think the first thing I'm going to
do is work with loading the dictionary words,

54
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,760
just so we've got some data to play with.

55
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm going to start by making
a type alias for the dictionary

56
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:25,394
and for our purposes the dictionary
is just going to be a list of text values.

57
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,988
And the text there is the type from Data.Text.

58
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,314
And I think I'll make a new function, readDictionary

59
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,034
which will take the file path
and give me back a dictionary.

60
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,108
I'll take that out for now.

61
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,577
We're going to need the Data Text library
as well, so I'll add that to the Cabal file.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,914
And because I'm using nix I'm
going to need to add it to my nix file as well.

63
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:11,428
so that's going to just pull down my dependencies.

64
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:25,150
OK. We do need a main, so let's stub that out for now.

65
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:30,445
SP: So the underscore
you're leaving there is the hole?

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,205
OC: Yes, so if we expand the compilation buffern
it says that there are two holes in this program.

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,708
We need to provide some type of computation

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,680
that's going to be an io
action that will return a dictionary.

69
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,910
And we also have another hole for main as well.

70
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,280
SP: And this is a new feature in the latest GHC?

71
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,571
OC: yes. I think this came in GHC 7.8.

72
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,520
So  I'll leave the hole in main for now,

73
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,660
because it's probably going to
be one of the last ones we fill in.

74
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,645
I'll work on reading this dictionary.

75
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,777
I think I'm going to switch over to Hackage now, and
look at the documentation from the Text Library.

76
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,074
This module has all sorts of IO routines
that are going  to give us text values back,

77
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,540
and the one that I'm interested in is readfile,

78
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,914
which takes a file path that
gives us back a single text strength,

79
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,820
and then we can split
that up into a dictionary later.

80
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,834
The first thing I'm going to do...

81
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,794
The text library tends to work
best if you use qualified imports.

82
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:41,680
So I'm going to import Data.Text as T.

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,788
SP: So you're just avoiding the confusion
of clobbering the built-ins in the prelude.

84
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,091
OC: Yes, the prelude has things
like length, filter and stuff like that,

85
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,530
but text also has length and filter.

86
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,205
So to avoid ambiguous names
I'm going to import that entirely qualified.

87
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,611
SP: So it's about hiding the
prelude symbols, explicitly?

88
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,577
OC: Yes, I'm probably not going to be using the prelude stuff very much,

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,540
but that will save me some hassle.

90
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,211
I'm going to have a type hole in
there so I've got some well formed syntax.

91
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,434
And now I have a hole that needs to be a dictionary.

92
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:22,114
And I have available dictionary
contents which is a piece of text.

93
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:26,480
So I need to split this
single text string into a list of lines.

94
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:35,337
I believe we have a function to do that
in the Text Library as well, which is un-line. (Inaudible)

95
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:38,685
Which is going to break
the text up into a list of texts.

96
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:41,600
SP: It's the exact analogue
of the lines in the prelude.

97
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,148
OC: Exactly. The Text type itself is very
similar to the String type in the prelude.

98
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,542
Except the String type is quite inefficient.

99
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,370
It's just a linked list of characters,

100
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,820
whereas the Text type is more
efficient in terms of its representation.

101
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,251
SP: So you make a point of defaulting to the Text type?
whereas the Text type is more
efficient in terms of its representation.

102
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:57,200
SP: So you make a point of defaulting to the Text type?

103
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:04,200
OC: Yes inaudible

104
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,885
Now I can just take the lines of dictionary contents.

105
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:17,737
Now I should have a way to read the dictionary.

106
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,205
I'm going to switch back to my
terminal and load that up into GCHi

107
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,200
and then we can have a play with that.

108
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:34,902
I need to refresh my shell to
bring down that text dependency.

109
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,931
(Ollie types).

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,034
We've still got these holes here
which prevents me from using GHCi.

111
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,782
But, I can use another feature of a
later version of GHC called defer-type errors.

112
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,245
Which is going to let me load
code which doesn't strictly type check.

113
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,794
But as long as I don't run something that
doesn't type check, I can still evaluate the program.

114
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,314
I can work around the fact that
I've got an incomplete bit of code

115
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,857
and I can run the bits I'm working on.

116
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,297
SP: So does it effectively replace that code
with undefined and then compile it all anyway?

117
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:13,890
OC: We can find out. It's the main
function that we haven't defined, so if I call main.

118
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:17,340
Well actually it doesn't terminate at all (laughter).

119
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,200
But we do have readDictionary.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:35,622
So why don't we try: readDictionary and "wordlist.txt".

121
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:41,051
I'm going to bind that into - no I'm not 

122
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:48,102
When emacs cooperates, I'm going
to bind that into a variable called dict.

123
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:50,285
SP: It's not going to print it straight off is it?

124
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,828
OC: No, because of the size of the
dictionary, I want to put that in a variable 

125
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:57,314
so I can try and read out a few things from it.

126
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:00,102
So we'll take the length of the dictionary.

127
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,137
It's a pretty large dictionary.

128
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,994
So we have to be quite efficient in
the way we search through this.

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
But we do seem to have got some stuff.

130
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,725
I guess we've got some windows line
endings there. Which is going to be annoying.

131
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:24,971
I'll probably want to trim that stuff out.

132
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,057
SP: Feel free to convert the file, If you want
to change the line endings that's fine with me.

133
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:41,097
OC: Maybe if we just filter those carriage
returns out that might be easy enough.

134
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,920
Let's see if that's any better.

135
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,268
So I'm happy with that.

136
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,920
We're just filtering out carriage
returns on the whole dictionary string.

137
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,548
So it looks like the dictionary has loaded up fine.

138
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,754
So now we're ready to start solving the problem.

139
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:16,091
There's no real reason to
restrict ourselves to the IO monad here.

140
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:19,508
This feels like it should be
solvable just with pure functions.

141
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,960
SP: Yes.

142
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:27,051
So I'm going to introduce a top level
function called... we'll go with word puzzle,

143
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:33,897
which is going to take 2 text strings,
which are going to be our start and end strings. 

144
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,314
And the dictionary I think I'll
bring that in as the first argument.

145
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,880
So a possible solution is going to be a list of words,

146
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,902
But I imagine there are multiple
possible solutions for some of these problems.

147
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,760
So I'm going to return a list of lists of words.

148
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:58,594
And because that's getting a bit confusing
we'll introduce a type in there called solution.

149
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,491
SP: Perhaps a word chain?

150
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,702
OC: Yes, good we'll go with word chain.

151
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,257
Which is going to be a list of text.

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,194
SP: So you'll get back a list of possible
chains from the first word to the second word.

153
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,274
OC: And if it's not possible to solve the
problem then we can just return the empty list.

154
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:21,140
Which says there are no possible word chains at all.

155
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,857
I'm going to try to solve this by pattern matching
basically and try to break the problem down slowly.

156
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:34,910
And hopefully we'll get to the solution that way.

157
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,942
And there's one really obvious pattern...

158
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,080
you gave me the restriction that
the words have to be the same length.

159
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,131
So if the words aren't the same length then
there's certainly no word chain between them.

160
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:49,782
I'll get that case out of the way.
I'm going to use a pattern guard for that.

161
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:57,180
If the length of a is not the lengt
 of b then I'll just return nothing.

162
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,628
Otherwise, I'll leave that to be solved.

163
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,910
OK so what have we got there?

164
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,740
It seems to be happy with that, 

165
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,434
We've got a hole on line 19 but that's
actually the problem we've got to solve.

166
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:25,428
So if I try now and solve the word puzzle with
our dictionary, between Hello and Haskell.

167
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,668
Whoops the dictionary
escaped, I'll just bring that back in.

168
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,620
I need to use an extension here
for GHC called overloaded strings.

169
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:36,662
Normally when we quote a
string, it has the type string,
I need to use an extension here
for GHC called overloaded strings.

170
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:39,851
Normally when we quote a
string, it has the type string,

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,034
but obviously we are working with text values.

172
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:47,920
So the overloaded string extension
is going to let us use literal strings,

173
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,310
but they will have a type text.

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,674
And as we would expect- Hello and Haskell don't
have the same length so there's no solution at all.

175
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,497
We can move on now to
actually try and find some solutions.

176
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,360
SP: Might I suggest another case where
we might be able to rule out possible solutions?

177
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,445
OC: Sure.

178
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,668
SP: So if either of the
words are not in the dictionary

179
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:12,994
I don't know if you
want to handle that now.

180
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,960
OC: No that seems reasonable.

181
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,062
I've just had a thought that

182
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,540
I might want to have
a more efficient dictionary type,

183
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,942
but we'll come to that later.

184
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,325
So we're given two words A and B:

185
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,845
I think that's what we want.

186
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,765
See if that compiles:

187
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,205
SP: You'll probably find that
Haskell will not be in the dictionary.

188
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,794
OC: OK well we can check that...

189
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,394
It is in the dictionary! (laughter)

190
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:22,308
SP: It's a respectable word!

191
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,474
I guess then we
probably need to deal with case,

192
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,331
or maybe I should be case sensitive

193
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,770
Capital Hello is not in the dictionary.

194
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,080
Lower case however, will be. Yes

195
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,280
I think I'll leave that for now.

196
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,720
SP: I think that's how it should work. Yes.

197
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:43,600
OC: OK

198
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,370
SP: Let's presume
that the input would be exactly

199
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,710
as it is in the dictionary

200
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,931
or it's strictly considered invalid.

201
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,085
OC: OK.

202
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,165
And I expect
there's another obvious pattern,

203
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,114
which is, regardless of the dictionary,

204
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,570
we have two words
A and B, and they are the same,

205
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,977
then we're done..
so that has one possible solution,

206
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,457
and I think I'm still
going to put that solution

207
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,931
in the word chain.

208
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,680
So if we go from
hello to hello, the solution will be

209
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,370
one word chain
which contains just the word hello.

210
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,188
so we can try that one two.

211
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,662
So let's see:

212
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,731
It does indeed have one solution

213
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,777
which is the word chain hello. Good!

214
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:39,577
So, beyond that
we've ruled out the obvious case

215
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,862
and we need to start doing some real work.

216
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,571
And I think a useful
function that we're going

217
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,740
to need is something that's
going to determine the distance

218
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,811
between two words.

219
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,165
Which is going to
be the amount of changes

220
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,360
you have to make
to get between two words.

221
00:16:53,497 --> 00:16:55,931
SP: Yes, or at least whether they are

222
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,570
one step apart from each other.

223
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,805
OC: Yes

224
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,880
The neighbors are going to be words

225
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,731
some distance away... by one

226
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:13,805
So let's have:

227
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:17,310
Distance is going to take two text values

228
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,620
and give us back a number.

229
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,422
So if they are the
same then of course,

230
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,125
the distance is just zero.

231
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,314
So how we going to do this next...let's see.

232
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,451
I'm probably
going to break the string apart

233
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,474
and treat it as if it were a list,

234
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,811
and I will compare the head,

235
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,782
and see if they're
different, and if they're not

236
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,622
the distance there is zero

237
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,790
but if they're different
the difference will be one.

238
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:49,097
SP: Are you once again assuming
that A and B are the same length?

239
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,211
OC: Yes I'm going to assume
for this function they are the same length.

240
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:00,537
and if not, well it might actually
work even if they're different lengths.

241
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,765
SP:  What comes to my mind is
zipping the characters of the two together

242
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:09,565
and seeing how many pairs are not identical.

243
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,902
OC: Yes, that sounds like
the kind of thing we could do.

244
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,740
I think now because we're zipping,

245
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,571
even if they're different lengths

246
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:19,110
we can probably just
drop the extra characters.

247
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,370
And I think we have
a zip function already

248
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,708
in the text library... we do.

249
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,628
that's going to compare characters.

250
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:36,102
It works on text so we can only
use it to zip two pieces of text

251
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:38,140
which is not so useful.

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,331
So take A and B and
we will zip A and B

253
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,170
so I'm going to use type (inaudible) here.

254
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,377
OK, So we need to have
a function which takes a list

255
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,902
of pairs of characters to a number.

256
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:06,560
I think first thing we'll do is map over those,

257
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:09,862
so we can consider each
pair of characters independently.

258
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:18,594
Oh dear, I'll ignore that for now, next type hole

259
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,140
we have a pair of characters,

260
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,910
which have to produce something.

261
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:37,291
So if x is equal to y... then zero otherwise one...

262
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,910
That's one possible
correction we have to do.

263
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,280
Now we need to take
a list of things like a number.

264
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,462
I don't know why it hasn't...
Oh, because B could be any type of numeric.

265
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,457
Ok, so that's good.

266
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,880
So it's hacking into our distance functions

267
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,582
we can switch back to GHCi

268
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,434
and see what it makes of that.

269
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,714
So let's see if the difference between

270
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,320
dog and cog is indeed one.

271
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:15,794
That's what you would expect. A basic example.

272
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's see how we can
fit this into our word puzzle.

273
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:28,540
We're certainly going
to need the dictionary and our two words

274
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,262
So I'm going to start with the word A

275
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,708
and we need to
find the neighbors of word A.

276
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:49,714
Let's filter the dictionary
so we don't have A in it.

277
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,211
That's going to give me a
dictionary that doesn't have A in it.

278
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,240
Maybe if we pair
every word with its distance

279
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:17,005
so I can take every word in the dictionary

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,280
and find its distance against word A,

281
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:22,777
and then I can take
the ones that just have a distance of 1

282
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:26,651
and that again feels like
I'm zipping 2 lists together.

283
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,217
SP: OK.

284
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,114
OC:  First we need to map that for every word.

285
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,531
We're going to keep
the word and I'm also going to keep

286
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,817
the distance between A and W.

287
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,331
Actually this is like what I'm saying.

288
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,222
Let's say:

289
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,085
And now we've got this map

290
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:09,222
and we need to filter this for all things

291
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,977
that have a distance of exactly 1.

292
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,394
So let's filter:

293
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:27,862
It's a bit long there... I'll re-format that slightly.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,954
Bit of a hole there, we can come back to that,

295
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,710
so does that build.

296
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:47,120
OK, so what have we got here?

297
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:54,685
Ah, OK, so I've filtered this
but I also need to map it

298
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,445
just so it will take the word, so that's A.

299
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,468
and once more, and take just the word

300
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,680
and ignore its distance.

301
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:06,994
SP: Is there a function for that, is it fst?

302
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,057
OC: Yes, we can use fst there.

303
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,205
Good, so we're
back to compiling once more.

304
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,994
So I'll give that a try.

305
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,685
Let's find neighbors of dog.

306
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:46,800
We need the dictionary there as well.

307
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,011
It doesn't seem quite right to me (laughter)

308
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:55,668
SP: I think this is probably a result of zipping,

309
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,754
and not taking into
consideration that if the lengths

310
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:05,870
of the two words are
different, then zip would finish

311
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,525
at the shortest sequence. OC: Right.

312
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,228
SP: And so, all of these like 'downfall'

313
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:16,571
would be only
one letter away from 'dog',

314
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,040
so maybe you should
only look at the first one.

315
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,940
OC: Maybe we should be
filtering the dictionary first

316
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:24,428
on getting words
that are only the same length.

317
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,510
We certainly have done that here.
SP: Yes

318
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:40,540
OC: I'm going to bring
in some smaller functions there.

319
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,971
The idea here is I'm probably
going to use the Applicative Syntax

320
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,428
to combine 2 boolean operations together

321
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,880
so I want to take
things that are not equal to A.

322
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,331
SP: And also the /= operator?

323
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,885
OC: Oh yes, of course,

324
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,370
in fact we'll put that directly in there.

325
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,697
So we need it to satisfy 2 conditions.

326
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,820
We should be able to do this:

327
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,194
I think we'll probably be
able to tidy that function up as well.

328
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,137
So I'll take those back out,

329
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,600
and we're going to
need to import Control.Applicative.

330
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:50,662
SP: So I notice here that
even though you presumably knew

331
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,085
that you were going
to import Control.Applicative

332
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:59,108
your habit is to immediately try compiling

333
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:01,420
and have the compiler to tell you that.
OC: Yes.

334
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,188
SP: So this is really an
analogue of the TDD work-flow

335
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,405
where you are going for the failing test?

336
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:08,902
OC: That's right yes,

337
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,280
And I have to context switch again.

338
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,400
I've used length from the prelude here,

339
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,620
but we have text values

340
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,771
and length cannot be used on text values.

341
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:36,731
inaudible strings so we need to use T.length.

342
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,000
So hopefully we're back to compiling that.

343
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,114
So let's try that one again.

344
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:49,428
See if it makes more sense this time.

345
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,080
That looks a lot better to me.

346
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,925
OK!

347
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:01,805
SP: Now Ollie could
you explain this section here

348
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:06,217
where you've used
the operators from Control.Applicative.

349
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,262
OC:  We're working
under the reader applicative here,

350
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,200
which is basically
an applicative functor

351
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,970
that works for function arrows.

352
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,620
So what I want to
do is, take the same argument

353
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,280
as I filter over the dictionary

354
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,885
for every word in the dictionary.

355
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:23,220
I need to check  that
that word is not equal to A.

356
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,280
And I also need to check that its length

357
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,680
is equal to the length of A.

358
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,217
So I need to do an
operation on the same value.

359
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,165
SP: Right

360
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,462
OC: So I could have introduced a lambda here

361
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,542
and banged that to a variable called W

362
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:38,022
and said W is not equal to A

363
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:41,462
and that the length
of W is the length of A.

364
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,902
But by using this syntax here, it's going to

365
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:48,210
implicitly thread that argument
through to both the functions for me.

366
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,040
So I don't have to worry
about passing the right argument in.

367
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,331
By using the right structure
here that kind of comes for free.

368
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,600
And there's one other
thing I want to tidy up

369
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,085
this is looking a bit weird,

370
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,594
and we've got some helpful

371
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:02,982
functions in the Data.Function library,

372
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,611
that comes in the base library of Haskell,

373
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,370
so I'm wondering if
we can use something there.

374
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,020
I'm going to have a quick look at the base library

375
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,220
just to see if anything looks useful there.

376
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,417
SP: Do you tend to use Hoogle?

377
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,777
OC: I do use Hoogle occasionally but that's more

378
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:23,310
when I know the function
that I'm going to work with,

379
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,400
whereas in this case
I just want to look at the types

380
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,340
and see if anything stands out.

381
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,910
SP: Because in Hoogle
you can search by the type.

382
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,405
OC: Right yes, but here
I suppose I'm not entirely sure

383
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,370
what type I'm
going to be looking for.

384
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,177
I want to just look through it
and see if anything comes intuitively.

385
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,611
But if we don't find
anything then I will leave it for now.

386
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:43,737
But it's these combinates down here, like 'on'

387
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:47,740
which is probably going to be the most useful.

388
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,770
So, you can see that 'on' as a typical usage

389
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,450
lets you call the same function

390
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,910
on two different arguments.

391
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:55,394
So let's see if we can use that.

392
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:58,240
So we're certainly going to be doing 'on'

393
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,331
well it takes 2 arguments and...

394
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,754
It takes a function of two arguments

395
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,422
and also a function of one argument.

396
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,360
Well our function one argument is T.length,

397
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,605
and our function two arguments is just equality.

398
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,028
So we need the check for equality on length.

399
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,800
So you can normally use it

400
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,360
with infix notation like this,

401
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,062
but that's when you've
got two arguments to supply.

402
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:36,765
We're only going to supply one argument,

403
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,600
so I think I'm actually
going to switch this back round

404
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,280
and do a normal prefix notation.

405
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,308
So 'on' equality, T.length against 'A'

406
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,020
and it's going to
supply us with  a second argument

407
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,170
for each word in the dictionary.

408
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,280
SP: Right.

409
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:52,650
OC: So compile that
and we're going to be told

410
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,940
that we need to import it,

411
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,657
so let's bring that in... and that's in... Data.Function.

412
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,800
Good! So that's back to compiling

413
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:08,994
and we're back in the hole here.

414
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:10,137
So I think I'm happy with that,

415
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:13,017
it's a fairly
clean readable description.

416
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,074
We do have quite a lot of loops going on there,

417
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,880
but I'm going to ignore that for now,

418
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,657
maybe we can
optimize that later, but for now

419
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:21,680
that's certainly solved the problem.

420
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,940
For our actual
word puzzle problem, we know

421
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,540
that the words
are different, but the same length.

422
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm going to find all the
neighbors around the word A,

423
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,540
and then try and find all of the solutions

424
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,982
from all of the neighbors of A.

425
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:40,640
See if any of them gets us to B.

426
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,510
In which case those will be our
possible solutions.

427
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,857
OC: So we'll start by taking the neighbors of A.

428
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,770
and the same dictionary [inaudible].

429
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,600
I've got a hole here

430
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,771
so I'm going to write some sort of function

431
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,680
that will take all these neighbors.

432
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,510
Let's have a look at the type of that.

433
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,340
We're going to
have a list of text and we need

434
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,800
to go to a list of word chains.

435
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,657
so that list of text
is all the possible neighbors

436
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,377
So I'm going
to map over that and now

437
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:18,057
I have the function that
goes from  text to word chain.

438
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:18,628
SP: OK.

439
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,211
OC: So how is best to do this.

440
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,085
Even though this has
the same type, I want to see what we get to.

441
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,285
We're going to be using the same dictionary

442
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:52,731
and were going to go to B and go on to N
and N to B.

443
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,120
That's probably not going to type check.

444
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,970
We couldn't match a list of text with text.

445
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,714
Oh! that's because
the word chain is a list of text

446
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:05,897
It's expecting a single word chain

447
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:07,940
but we've actually
got many word chains.

448
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:11,017
So I think the
problem here is that if we

449
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,622
put another
type hole there, we'll see that this

450
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:15,080
could actually typecheck,

451
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,400
provided we
had a function that went from

452
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,285
a list of lists of word
chains to just a list of word chains.

453
00:32:20,297 --> 00:32:21,680
Which is of course 'concat',

454
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,462
And we have a
function in the standard library...

455
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm gonna remove that hole.

456
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,800
There's a function
in the standard library that does

457
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,770
these two things together... concatMap

458
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,570
because it's such a common operation.

459
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,531
concatMap that there... and

460
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,253
I guess we'll leave that

461
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,540
as a hole for now and play with it in GHCi again.

462
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,280
If I load the dictionary,
I should be able to now

463
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:52,600
try of one of the example problems.

464
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,693
Let's try:

465
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,693
That is impressively slow right now (laughter)

466
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,920
And I'm not sure if that's
because this doesn't terminate

467
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,000
or because we're being so inefficient.

468
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:16,400
SP: Now... By the time you go from dog to dot

469
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,613
one of the neighbors of dot is dog.

470
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:22,466
OC: So we're actually
going back on ourselves probably

471
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,346
SP: That's potentially what's happening.

472
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,370
That sounds very reasonable to me. Yes.

473
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,653
so we need to probably
carry some extra state around.

474
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,440
So I'm going to put this down here.

475
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,946
We probably need to remove
something from the dictionary

476
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,786
which I guess is going
to be when we go here:

477
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,333
It will probably want to be a dictionary

478
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:53,310
without the word N itself.

479
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,213
And also not A.

480
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,600
I've already removed A here

481
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,160
so I'm wondering
if maybe that should be done

482
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:05,373
further up here.

483
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,880
We'll try it anyway,
let's just try it here.

484
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:20,586
So let's filter the dictionary

485
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,000
for stuff that's not equal to N.

486
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,880
It's still compiling...

487
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,257
That's better but apparently
we now have no solutions at all,

488
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,813
at least we do terminate. (laughter)

489
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,680
SP: So termination but wrong
is better than no termination.

490
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,514
OC: I think so. At least
we know that it will eventually

491
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:54,542
deliver an answer even if it
is the wrong answer.

492
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,826
So what I want to check now,

493
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,373
we expected this sort of chain dog, cog,

494
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:03,666
cot to cat, so maybe if we just try cot to cat

495
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,373
and see if we get that solution.

496
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,240
OC: For the smallest thing I can think of

497
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:11,880
that was cot to cat.

498
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:14,800
Again that seems to have no solutions.

499
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,910
It does indeed contain
cat it's right there at the start,

500
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,542
so we should certainly be seeing that.

501
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,540
So let's see:

502
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,133
The neighbors around
A... and for each of those

503
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,800
we call a word puzzle.

504
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:43,986
The same target...

505
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,746
SP: So here you're excluding
words that are the neighbor

506
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,000
OC: Yes

507
00:35:57,026 --> 00:36:00,613
SP: Perhaps instead you should be excluding A.

508
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:06,960
Because that's the one you
don't want to return to later.

509
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,942
You know that you've got that one.

510
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,680
OC: Great job!

511
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,520
So we don't want to
come back to where we started

512
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,200
that certainly does make sense.

513
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,653
And now we go from cot to cat.

514
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,426
OC: We're certainly finding some solutions

515
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:41,653
but never stopping the search (laughter).

516
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:44,080
which is interesting. So, what's going on there?

517
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,373
when we loop over there this...

518
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,533
Well I'm interested to see
if this will actually terminate

519
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,600
and be the same length as
all the neighbors of cot.

520
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,733
But maybe this won't terminate.

521
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,253
OK, maybe not (laughter).

522
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,310
SP: The fan indicated that some work
was being done (laughter)

523
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,570
OC: Although, are we actually able to fully
compute all of the neighbors around "cot"?
We certainly are OK.

524
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,413
So, we're not hitting our base case properly,

525
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,600
which is interesting.

526
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,450
We're certainly getting here

527
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:39,853
because that's where we return the result.

528
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,053
Maybe if we take all
the solutions of neighbor.

529
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,373
So if we couldn't find any
solutions there then we won't

530
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:05,280
be able to find any bigger solutions.

531
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,226
If we did find a solution

532
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:20,306
then we should be able to go for it.

533
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:26,013
Yes, that seems reasonable.

534
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,320
So I think that's largely OK.

535
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:35,213
We've got an error there somewhere.

536
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,506
So N is expecting a word chain

537
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:42,240
that's actually a piece of text.

538
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,080
That seems somewhat odd.

539
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,600
SP: So the word puzzle
will return a list of solutions

540
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,866
so do you not need to prepend

541
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:59,626
each of the items in that list of solutions?

542
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,800
OC: Ah! of course, yes.

543
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,293
SP: So I think it would be just 'map of' prepend.

544
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:08,146
OC: Yes. We could also use Applicative Syntax

545
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,020
which is not much different,

546
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,450
but we could also do something like that

547
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,453
for every S we're going to prepend it with N.

548
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,050
SP: Right

549
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:21,413
OC: OK, so we're back to compiling again

550
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,346
Let's see if we can make any sense of that.

551
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,626
Cat to cat and then
every other word in the dictionary.

552
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,940
We're eventually getting to
cat. That's certainly happening.

553
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,986
I guess that is a valid word chain (laughter).

554
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,466
Is it just that there are this
many possible word chains I guess

555
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,133
The first one is certainly wrong though.

556
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,520
That's certainly not a chain from cat to cat.

557
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:58,970
That should be cot to cat.

558
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,080
I better start fixing that bug:

559
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:09,940
SP: They are very long chains

560
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,920
Cod to cat was the next one.

561
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:15,110
OC: They're certainly valid chains though.

562
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,640
SP: Yes

563
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:26,080
OC: So what's going wrong on that first one though?

564
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:28,386
We have cat.

565
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,653
The problem is I think
we should have been prepending...

566
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,906
A rather than N - or possibly both of them.

567
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:41,400
Let's just see what that
is, because we want to go

568
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,970
from the word we're starting at.

569
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,080
and now we certainly have
the right solution at the front.

570
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,506
And we can of course exploit laziness,

571
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,546
hopefully just see the very first solution

572
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:57,986
and it terminates.

573
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,285
And finally that's one word chain

574
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,942
that has certainly got us there.

575
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,013
SP: OK.

576
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,850
OC: So we need to decide
where we want to go next.

577
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,110
If we want to find
all possible word chains,

578
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,680
in a short amount of time,
or if we want to make sure

579
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,940
that this is definitely the shortest chain.

580
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,986
At this point, finding the
shortest chain we just need

581
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:21,773
to sort by the length descending.

582
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:26,000
But this now because
we're sorting the entire list

583
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Is going to have to consider
the entire set of possible solutions.

584
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:32,880
SP: We probably need to think about

585
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,626
expanding the chains progressively,

586
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:44,480
and returning first the
ones that are the shortest.

587
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,573
OC: Right so a greedier
search, as we go through.

588
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm going to try and see how long it takes

589
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,946
to solve the whole list of solutions.

590
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:58,893
We have a function here, 'sort by' which takes

591
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:02,306
a list of type A and if we
have a way to compare them

592
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:04,146
for an ordering we can do something.

593
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:10,426
So Data.Function also has,
or it might be in Data.Ord

594
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,200
We have comparing.

595
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:21,453
So we can say comparing on length [inaudible]

596
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,013
which is just what we want

597
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,946
a word chain as a  list of texts.

598
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:31,840
So sort by comparing length

599
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,480
and it's certainly not a good solution.

600
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,770
In the original spec of the kata it said

601
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,600
it should be returning
results in less than a second

602
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,973
but we're well over that.

603
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,733
So I think we got our one
solution there from cog to cat,

604
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,546
purely by chance because
cat comes first in the dictionary.

605
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:10,866
What we're doing here is
basically a depth first search.

606
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:12,693
OC: So the moment we hit that one neighbor,

607
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:13,920
we go as far away as we can

608
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:15,520
to try and get all the way to cat which is

609
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,133
not really the most efficient use of our time.

610
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,506
We're going to need to
change this from a depth first solution

611
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:22,650
to a breadth first solution.

612
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,933
What we're going to do
is go over each of the neighbors

613
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:28,520
and try to expand that
word chain of the neighbor

614
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:29,386
to go one bigger,

615
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,253
and hopefully we will eventually end at B.

616
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,693
B is certainly in the dictionary,

617
00:43:35,706 --> 00:43:37,613
in which case we've
finished our breadth first search.

618
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:40,000
At least to get the shortest path.

619
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,420
SP: And since you're removing the word each time

620
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,573
eventually you won't be able to expand

621
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,586
your search any further

622
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,546
because you'll run out of
neighbors for the next word.

623
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,706
OC, Yes. So I'm going to leave
word puzzle alone for the moment

624
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,320
Instead let's try and use some kind of

625
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:58,546
expand function.

626
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,320
So that's going to take a
word chain and give us back

627
00:44:02,346 --> 00:44:04,640
all possible expansions of the word chain,

628
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,746
We need the dictionary there as well.

629
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,770
I think that's what I want to do.

630
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,820
We're going to work
from the head of the chain

631
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,020
and try to expand that.

632
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,546
There is obviously the
case where we've got

633
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,346
no words at all in the chain.

634
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,666
That's not really an
invariant I want to have in the code.

635
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,740
But we should probably deal with it anyway
in which case there's no expansions on that.

636
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,920
Otherwise we have a
word on some other words

637
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:51,000
and now by all the
neighbors in the dictionary.

638
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:56,920
W and put those on the
word chain we've got so far.

639
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,400
So neighbors gives us a list of words and

640
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,106
that's already a list of word chains.

641
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:22,173
I find the neighbors of w
but I need to use a

642
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:24,050
list cons there.

643
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,453
I'm going to move away from
putting this there.
Just map over these.

644
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,426
SP: That's not a bad example
of a case for a miscomprehension.

645
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:47,373
OC: OK.

646
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,280
OC: Sure well let's try
another one of those conventions

647
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,910
we need to... go over there.

648
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,200
the neighbors and dict and w

649
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,920
and we'll put that into binding n.

650
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,613
Now I need to
produce a single word chain here,

651
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:22,173
that will be n, w, ws, I think.

652
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,400
And we're back to compiling again - good.

653
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:35,040
I should be able to load the dictionary in

654
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:44,573
and expand and type that back up...

655
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,520
And word chains, so why don't
I just start with the word cat.

656
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,940
So that seems to be doing
what I would expect,

657
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,770
the expansion is on the front.

658
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,680
So now let's see if we can
feed this back in to our word puzzle.

659
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,866
I think I'll leave this around for now
and just comment that out.

660
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,986
So we're going to start at
word a and we need

661
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:14,373
to reach word b.

662
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,850
So we'll start with a word chain

663
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,520
which is just the word a

664
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:21,933
That's a chain of one word.

665
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,253
I will expand that to
a list of possible word chains.

666
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,986
Let's see what I need to do with that.

667
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,370
Well that one actually works so far,

668
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,013
but it's certainly
not going to be the solution.

669
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:40,333
Now I should be able to...

670
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,586
So that's just a one
level breadth-first search.

671
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,533
We need to go a bit further
than that to find something useful,

672
00:47:54,546 --> 00:48:00,133
so I think now
we just need to keep expanding

673
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:08,120
until we have B at the front of the list.

674
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,786
SP: Yes.

675
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,786
OC: We can probably use
iterate to do that.

676
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:16,213
SP: Or until you don't
have any further expansions.

677
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,906
OC: Ah! that's one
thing we've not done so far

678
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,960
is reducing this dictionary.

679
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,826
Where would I put that in?

680
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:33,160
so after one expansion,
this is probably returning me

681
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,770
a smaller dictionary as well.

682
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,220
When I expand a word chain
the dictionary becomes smaller.

683
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,940
SP: That would be reasonable.

684
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,373
OC: Let's see what we get with that...

685
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,226
so word chain and the dictionary.

686
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,760
SP: The alternative is that
you keep the dictionary the same

687
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,440
each time, but you
don't allow the addition

688
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:10,160
into the chain of
a word that's already in it.

689
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,426
OC: Yes, but we're going to keep searching

690
00:49:14,426 --> 00:49:15,760
through a word chain every time,

691
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,946
it feels like we just
make the dictionary smaller

692
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:20,910
then our neighbors
gradually become smaller.

693
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,373
So we return the list of
possible word chains as before.

694
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,280
Now I'm thinking
it would be nice if we had

695
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,053
a richer type for our dictionary.

696
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,413
Like a set or something like
that, so I can do a set difference

697
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:39,306
and easily remove a set of words from it.

698
00:49:39,306 --> 00:49:40,306
SP: Yes.

699
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,426
OC: So that's going to be
a bit of a backtrace

700
00:49:43,426 --> 00:49:45,226
but I think it's going to be worth it.

701
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:51,960
so I'm going to import
the Data.Set library as well

702
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,040
and that also works best
when you import qualified.

703
00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:03,946
We need to depend on
the containments library for that.

704
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,946
And to get that
I need to put that in there.

705
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,893
Actually, it looks as if
we already have that.

706
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,786
Bit of a misnomer there I reckon.

707
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,106
So now that we've got set
imported maybe we can make this...

708
00:50:28,146 --> 00:50:30,110
So rather than having a list of text,

709
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,813
let's go with a set text,

710
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,580
and we'll just ask the compiler to tell us

711
00:50:35,586 --> 00:50:38,720
everything we need to update, to change.

712
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,260
The first thing we need to do
is return a set rather than a list.

713
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,160
That's easy enough,
we can just say S.fromList.

714
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,820
which takes a list
and turns it into a set.

715
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:57,373
Next, rather than checking
a list to see if an element's there,

716
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:03,080
use S.member,
which checks to see if an element

717
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,520
is a member of a set.

718
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:07,600
Likewise going to do the same here...

719
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,066
That has put a hole back there.

720
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:31,960
That should probably just return.

721
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:36,493
like that...

722
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,106
The filter is for lists but we
have a set so
we ask S.filter to filter a set.

723
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,306
I'll check the type of that in there.

724
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,533
OK, I've some idea
of where that error came up.

725
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,920
Ah yes,  we can't map over a set like that.

726
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:23,813
Do we have that... yes we do...
so we just change that to S.map

727
00:52:24,866 --> 00:52:29,510
and again to S.filter, S.map.

728
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:32,173
Now this is not going
to give us a list of text,

729
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:33,826
it's going to give us a set of text.

730
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,893
SP: There are built in facilities
like traversible.

731
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:49,866
Does that help with
this sort of code

732
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,346
where you change
from one data type to another?

733
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,710
There are some
generalized forms of some of

734
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,506
these functions aren't there?

735
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,706
OC: Right. We can't
generalize map I don't think

736
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:03,373
because this is a set
and sets have the constraint

737
00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:05,906
that the things inside
the set must be order-able.

738
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:06,200
SP: Ok

739
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:08,480
So we can't map between
our 3 types because

740
00:53:08,493 --> 00:53:10,840
we wouldn't necessarily
map them to something that's order-able.

741
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,906
For filter, there's probably
some stuff in Data.Foldable

742
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:18,026
that will probably let us filter the set.

743
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:22,933
But I think I'm quite happy being explicit
that we're working with sets here.

744
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,626
SP: That's fine.

745
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,250
OC: I don't think generalizing

746
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,170
would give us much of a benefit here.

747
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,093
SP: Why I was wondering
is because I like to use that myself.

748
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,280
OC: Now we may not be able to
use the list comprehension anymore.

749
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,160
because we certainly don't have the list.

750
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,466
what we could do
though is just go to a list.

751
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,680
We could turn this into a list.

752
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:54,500
OK, and now we're back to
trying to solve this.

753
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,354
To recap where we were, we wanted to have

754
00:53:57,354 --> 00:53:59,662
the dictionary become
smaller and smaller so

755
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:02,142
we return the
word chain and now we need to

756
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:06,708
return the dictionary
but without a set of words

757
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,308
that we've already considered.

758
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:15,091
I believe those are
going to be the head of chains

759
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:18,417
that we just expanded to so that
will be all the neighbors again.

760
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:25,462
Although maybe it's more
beneficial to bring more neighbors out

761
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,697
as a separate binding.

762
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,702
So now we can take the
dictionary without any of the neighbors.

763
00:54:36,702 --> 00:54:39,020
I've got a slightly smaller
dictionary now.

764
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,748
And that still type checks.

765
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:47,257
We certainly want to call expand.

766
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:47,954
We need to work out

767
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,360
what were going to do with that result.

768
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,942
We have to write a
function that's going to take

769
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:53,771
a list of word chains in the dictionary,

770
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:55,708
and eventually gets to a word chain.

771
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,371
I think we'll end up using some functions

772
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:04,845
that are already in prelude anyway

773
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:07,622
but let's just follow the types manually,

774
00:55:07,622 --> 00:55:08,942
and see what we end up with.

775
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:11,491
OC: We have some function
f that's going to take a chain...

776
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:14,910
and a new dictionary
and it needs to do something,

777
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,325
and call f there as well.

778
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:26,102
Now we want to expand
every single one of these chains

779
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:27,680
using the smaller dictionary.

780
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,480
So do something with chain
and chain is of course not...

781
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,920
These type holes
aren't really helping us anymore

782
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,240
Just have to trust
our intuition a bit more.

783
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,622
but I should be able to map expand.

784
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,725
I should bring this down a little bit.

785
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,280
Expand takes the dictionary
in first position,

786
00:55:57,285 --> 00:55:59,800
and a word chain to expand second,

787
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:02,102
so that's going to work quite nicely.

788
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,668
Apart from (inaudible)

789
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:07,691
So that was a list of chains.

790
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:18,154
Going in the right direction there.

791
00:56:20,217 --> 00:56:23,205
We need to go from
a list of a list of word chains.

792
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:26,537
to probably a single word chain.

793
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,628
So, expanded every chain.

794
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:34,348
I'm going to have to call F on that again.

795
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:45,960
So, I think we're
struggling to find a nice kind of way

796
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,320
to repeatedly apply this expand function,

797
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,325
and what comes to mind here is,

798
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:54,177
it looks like an unfold
which is like the dual to fold,

799
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:55,382
which a lot of people are familiar with.

800
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:56,668
When you fold you have a list

801
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,125
and you keep reducing it
into something smaller.

802
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,977
Whereas in this case we
actually have something
and want to get something bigger.

803
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:03,710
Which as unfolding until the point

804
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,400
where we maybe can't go any bigger.

805
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,222
So we have a function in
the Prelude to do that

806
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,148
which is unfoldr.

807
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:16,897
But that requires for
this function that we have

808
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,971
something that returns Maybe any value.

809
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,514
OC: But this actually looks quite a lot

810
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,285
like what we have in expand here.

811
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,182
OC: But we don't have a Maybe here,

812
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:27,445
so the Maybe represents the fact that

813
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,131
you can't actually go any bigger,

814
00:57:29,131 --> 00:57:32,434
which is what we were
modeling here with this pattern match,

815
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:35,480
where we simply said
we have an empty list of word chains,

816
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,650
but that felt a bit weird,

817
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,971
so maybe let's try
bringing in a Maybe there.

818
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,171
SP: Maybe let's Maybe (laughter).

819
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,685
OC: Ok, so in this case
there's nothing we can do,

820
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:51,245
so we just say nothing.

821
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:52,565
Whereas in this case,

822
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,782
we have just that result of word chains.

823
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,850
NARRATOR: We're going to speed through
this section

824
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,577
because Ollie and Steve found themselves

825
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,280
deep into a Rabbit hole.

826
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,280
They eventually backtracked
on this idea of using unfoldr,

827
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:09,674
so let's skip ahead to the section

828
00:58:09,674 --> 00:58:11,080
where they changed course.

829
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,450
SP: You are typing faster
than I can think (laughter).

830
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,422
OC: Even though we're using unfold,

831
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:23,542
which does feel
like the right tool to be using

832
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,388
I think we're getting
ourselves into a bit of a muddle here.

833
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,000
And one of the big culprits

834
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,308
is what we're doing
in this expand function

835
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,171
so I'm going to try and simplify that

836
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,834
and see if a nice
solution comes out there.

837
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:36,891
What I'm going to go with instead ..

838
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,577
expand's going to take a single
word chain and the dictionary,

839
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,365
and it's going to expand that to a list

840
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,640
of possible word
chains and smaller dictionaries.

841
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,531
SP:OK

842
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,400
OC: So whenever I make one expansion,

843
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,680
I consider all of the neighbors around the

844
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,622
first word of the word chain.

845
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,582
And for each of those new word chains,

846
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:58,080
I'll have the neighbor at the front,

847
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,062
and we will remove
that word from the dictionary,

848
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,354
because we don't want
to go back on ourselves.

849
00:59:03,737 --> 00:59:05,540
So I have a word chain with nothing in

850
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,714
but there's nothing I can do.

851
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,457
We have seen this one before,

852
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,417
but otherwise if we have a chain.

853
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:15,028
and it starts with the word w,

854
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:18,148
we have the dictionary and then

855
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:24,348
we need to take the neighbors around w

856
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,520
which will equal n.

857
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,034
and put that on the front of the chain.

858
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,611
So n is going to be the neighbors

859
00:59:34,228 --> 00:59:36,371
using the same dictionary around w.

860
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,045
But we also need to return
this slightly smaller dictionary.

861
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,370
Tuple that up

862
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:49,651
with the same dictionary.

863
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,540
but we'll delete n from the dictionary.

864
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,388
SP: Right.

865
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:57,874
OC: Lets try that...

866
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:01,451
get rid of our old definition.

867
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,417
You can see this is very similar to what we had

868
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:05,874
in expandOne.

869
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:07,828
OC: so breaking the problem into a smaller one

870
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,194
So ignore this...

871
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,542
let's keep that.

872
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,910
And that's expecting a list
of text from the other set

873
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,577
So we need to turn that into a list

874
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:37,577
we're back - good!

875
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,740
I guess if we load the dictionary in

876
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:50,970
then we should be able to use expand with...

877
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,485
let's just look at the one expansion of cat. Oops.

878
01:00:54,862 --> 01:00:55,880
So what we're doing here is

879
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,080
we end up printing the out dictionary as well.

880
01:00:58,085 --> 01:01:00,114
SP: Yes, because it was in the (inaudible)

881
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,222
OC: Map first over that,

882
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:08,777
and we see just the one level expansion.

883
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:10,382
SP: Fantastic

884
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:13,971
So we're going to repeatedly apply this

885
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,731
but we'll keep the small chains.

886
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:17,850
Then we will have the
bigger chains on the end.

887
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:21,028
So that's basically giving
us a flattening of a tree,

888
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:22,365
of a breadth-first search.

889
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:26,520
Which I think is going to be
better than the depth first search

890
01:01:27,085 --> 01:01:28,148
that we saw earlier.

891
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:28,650
SP:  Yes.

892
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,897
I'm going to do a little
function up here called go.

893
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:44,371
Go is going to take
a list of word chains

894
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,588
and dictionaries.

895
01:01:46,817 --> 01:01:48,840
And this becomes apparent

896
01:01:48,931 --> 01:01:51,480
you can see how I'm
going to pull recursively.

897
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,685
And it's going to give us back a
list of word chains and dictionaries.

898
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:57,880
and that's going to let us
repeatedly apply this to ourselves.

899
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,491
OC: So if we have nothing in the first [inaudible]

900
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,220
There's nothing we can do, we simply return that

901
01:02:03,925 --> 01:02:08,308
Otherwise we have some
chains so what we can do...

902
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:11,120
SP: We have some
combinations of chains and dictionaries.

903
01:02:11,302 --> 01:02:12,994
OC: Yes, some chains and dictionaries indeed.

904
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,634
but for every word chain in the dictionary

905
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:17,880
we want to expand that word
chain using its own dictionary.

906
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,450
So I'm going to map over chains,

907
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,491
and what we'll have here is a word chain

908
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,697
and a dictionary, which we will expand

909
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,497
in a chain and a dictionary.

910
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:30,571
We're going to have
to concat like that because

911
01:02:30,577 --> 01:02:32,457
expand gives us a list of word chains and dictionaries.

912
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,474
SP: Can we rename chains there?

913
01:02:37,868 --> 01:02:41,668
OC: Sure, anything you're up to, a tad smaller

914
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,954
or did you want to drop it entirely?

915
01:02:43,954 --> 01:02:45,950
Because we could just...

916
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,594
No, we cant because we've
pattern matched on one here.

917
01:02:50,668 --> 01:02:51,620
SP: Maybe in pairs.

918
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:53,817
OC: Ok, because of the dictionary.

919
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:12,897
So that's OK...

920
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:16,502
But what we've done
now is, we've thrown away

921
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,740
these original chains.

922
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,325
we need to retain those as well.

923
01:03:19,325 --> 01:03:19,771
SP: Right.

924
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,394
OC: So we'll keep the pairs,

925
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,428
and then add on
the expansions afterwards.

926
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:30,845
SP: Yes.

927
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:33,114
So for the smaller chains
that might have already finished,

928
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:33,977
we'll keep those.

929
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,811
SP: And then later you
would look at all the chains

930
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:39,862
starting with the smallest first,

931
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:45,040
and try to select only the ones that

932
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,485
finish on the target word.

933
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:46,994
OC: Right.

934
01:03:47,148 --> 01:03:50,605
OC: And because in
expand we're putting neighbors

935
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,925
at the front of the list, were going to need to

936
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:55,714
filter word chains that start with our target

937
01:03:56,017 --> 01:03:59,588
It's a bit weird but
obviously cons is a lot more efficient

938
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:01,674
than append,  because we don't

939
01:04:01,674 --> 01:04:03,337
have to traverse the list at all.

940
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:05,200
SP: We can always reverse the solution.

941
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,474
OC: We could yes.

942
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,228
I'll just check that
that's all compiling, it does.

943
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,702
We should be able
to have a play with this now.

944
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,760
In our GHCi

945
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,531
So we've got go so I'll try...

946
01:04:20,217 --> 01:04:22,331
to bring the dictionary back into scope.

947
01:04:24,308 --> 01:04:26,874
Word chains plus words, so I'll try cat

948
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,714
and it needs a
dictionary in there as well.

949
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,080
And we'll start with just that one.

950
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:42,028
And that's going to expand forever,
so lets go one level into it with go

951
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,485
SP: Ok.

952
01:04:42,491 --> 01:04:43,908
OC: And take the head of that.

953
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:46,971
There's a lot of possibilities...

954
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:49,085
because of the dictionary.

955
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:54,777
We'll just take the word chains out of that.

956
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,050
SP: Just the first of head
OC: Oh yes

957
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,691
OC: So maybe,... rather than the head
SP: Now it's map first
OC: So every time we take one more

958
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,114
our chains get a bit longer.

959
01:05:13,114 --> 01:05:14,491
SP: Can you see the next one?

960
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:18,605
Oh! that's because we've flattened it, yes.

961
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:23,691
SP: That's not the level
that's just the chains as they change.

962
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:24,320
OC: Yes

963
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:27,250
SP: How about the first ten

964
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,565
OC: So gradually they're going
to start getting bigger at some point.

965
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:37,250
[inaudible]

966
01:05:45,062 --> 01:05:46,314
That's not recursing.

967
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:49,080
Actually go is never calling itself,

968
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,480
which is the problem here.

969
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:53,554
So were only ever
looking at one level expansion.

970
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,325
so if we take the original pairs and what we

971
01:05:57,331 --> 01:06:02,450
need to do is go again on the concatMap.

972
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:03,617
SP: Right

973
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,280
So we're going to keep
going to bigger and bigger chains.

974
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:10,697
But we're always putting these
chains on the end of the list.

975
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,954
So if we go back to taking 20 we should be

976
01:06:21,954 --> 01:06:23,085
back to where we were.

977
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,782
And as I take more, you can see we are

978
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:29,114
starting to get bigger and bigger chains now.

979
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,680
SP: Right, and all of them ending on cat.

980
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:32,268
OC: Yes.

981
01:06:35,022 --> 01:06:36,891
SP: That's because that was our start.

982
01:06:36,902 --> 01:06:39,222
OC: Yes, were going out from cat

983
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,000
SP: Suffering from the reverse order of reading

984
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:48,554
OC: So now were ready
to put this back into the wordPuzzle

985
01:06:48,554 --> 01:06:50,525
to solve the puzzle properly... again!

986
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,360
So we need to call
go and we're going to be

987
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:58,377
using the input-dictionary.

988
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:02,417
But were going to have
to delete our starting word

989
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,508
from the dictionary.

990
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:05,897
OC: Because we don't
want to go back to the start.

991
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:08,045
And we're going to
start with a word chain

992
01:07:08,045 --> 01:07:09,765
that begins at the word a

993
01:07:11,582 --> 01:07:13,771
And this is going to give us all the chains

994
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:14,514
that start from a

995
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,902
But we're interested
in chains that start at a

996
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:17,857
and finish at b

997
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:21,234
So we filter the result of chains

998
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,748
by  taking... for each chain.

999
01:07:26,257 --> 01:07:29,020
Sorry, first we should just throw away

1000
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:30,988
the extra dictionaries.

1001
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:33,897
SP: Because the tuples will come back from go.

1002
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:36,177
OC: Yes, so go will give us a tuple of word chains

1003
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:37,365
and dictionaries,

1004
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:39,805
whereas we're
only interested in word chains.

1005
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,080
So I'm mapping first over those.

1006
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,022
Now we've got a list of word chains.

1007
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,205
I can filter the list for
ones whose first element

1008
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,845
is equal to our target. [inaudible]

1009
01:07:54,022 --> 01:07:57,205
And I think that's all we need

1010
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:59,988
to solve the puzzle... so that all compiles

1011
01:08:04,651 --> 01:08:06,388
Read the dictionary back in

1012
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:08,942
I can do a wordPuzzle using the dictionary

1013
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:10,891
and we'll go from dog to cat.

1014
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:17,502
And we are indeed getting result.

1015
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,080
The interesting thing we're seeing here

1016
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,685
is as it's gradually printing results,

1017
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:27,714
we are seeing Haskells' lazy
evaluation works to our advantage.

1018
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,502
So if I only wanted
to get the very first result,

1019
01:08:30,508 --> 01:08:33,074
I could simply take
the head of all the solutions

1020
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:35,131
and the result is already done,

1021
01:08:35,131 --> 01:08:37,645
it didn't bother
computing all the extra values.

1022
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,748
But if I needed the extra results, maybe if I

1023
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:43,460
wanted to find
the first ten shortest chains

1024
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:46,434
I could just take10
and that's going to give you

1025
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:49,091
10 word chains and then terminate,

1026
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:50,868
which is really nice.

1027
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:56,337
OC: I think that solves
the problem that we had

1028
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,274
in the original problem spec.

1029
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:02,097
SP: Shall we try it on longer input?

1030
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,771
How about the words Ruby and Code.

1031
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:08,497
OC: OK so I'll take the first of those.

1032
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,120
It's certainly a lot slower but we do

1033
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,634
get a word chain in the end.

1034
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,948
So it might be worth trying to improve the forms

1035
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,022
of this next.

1036
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:39,314
SP: Absolutely, and there are longer examples

1037
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,182
such as from house to shout,

1038
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,982
we could see if that completes

1039
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:45,680
in a reasonable amount of time.

1040
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:49,542
This one's quite tricky
because the search space

1041
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,622
for it is quite large in the
dictionary that I've given you.

1042
01:09:53,805 --> 01:09:56,857
OC: This doesn't look like
it's terminating any time soon.

1043
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:01,194
SP: Maybe we can have a look and see

1044
01:10:01,194 --> 01:10:04,370
if we can determine where the bottleneck is?

1045
01:10:04,657 --> 01:10:06,560
OC: Yes, well I'm going to leave that one

1046
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,085
running in the
background anyway, see if we get a result

1047
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:11,310
while we start looking for some optimizations.

1048
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,080
To me, the biggest source of expense

1049
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,902
feels like this neighbours function.

1050
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:20,620
We're filtering twice and we map twice

1051
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,280
and we are doing this repeatedly

1052
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,800
every single time we expand.

1053
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,965
And the set of neighbors around a word

1054
01:10:27,325 --> 01:10:28,468
doesn't really change.

1055
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,434
There may be potential
neighbors that we can't consider

1056
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:33,620
because we've already looked at them once.

1057
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,370
and we would go back on ourselves.

1058
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,657
But we can probably prune
the set of neighbors afterwards

1059
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:43,600
I'm thinking maybe we can have an optimization

1060
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:45,331
where we have a map of neighbors

1061
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,257
It's going to be a map
from Text to its set of neighbors.

1062
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,485
And we should be able to

1063
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,714
pre-compute this against the dictionary.

1064
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,840
We're going to need the Map data type

1065
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:06,000
which comes from Data.Map.

1066
01:11:06,617 --> 01:11:08,942
again I'll be importing this from qualified.

1067
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,925
Now we look up the list of neighbors.

1068
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:24,131
We can still take the Dictionary as input

1069
01:11:24,137 --> 01:11:26,531
but rather than just taking that, we can also

1070
01:11:26,531 --> 01:11:28,440
take in a NeighbourMap.

1071
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:30,628
And the word to look up

1072
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,142
and it's going to give
us a set of neighbors again.

1073
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,897
And the reason I'm taking the dictionary

1074
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,251
is because we keep making that dictionary

1075
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,331
smaller and smaller. We want to make sure

1076
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:41,510
the neighbors we look up from this map

1077
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,657
are actually in the dictionary because

1078
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,177
we might have made the dictionary smaller

1079
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:46,971
and removed possible neighbors.

1080
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,708
so we're going to filter those out.

1081
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:52,205
OK, so I'll call that m and w.

1082
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:54,370
And this becomes straightforward,

1083
01:11:54,370 --> 01:12:01,080
we simply do a map look-up which is the exclamation operator

1084
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:04,634
which will throw up an error
if the word isn't in the map

1085
01:12:04,885 --> 01:12:07,954
but we'll have to gloss
over that for now I guess.

1086
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,600
SP: Avoiding the Maybes.

1087
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,965
OC: If I was doing this production code

1088
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,291
I would probably want
to keep the Maybes

1089
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,320
and the chance of it possibly failing,

1090
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,542
and reflect that in the types better.

1091
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,628
But for our purposes this should be sufficient.

1092
01:12:23,091 --> 01:12:25,691
So, this is saying in the map M

1093
01:12:25,697 --> 01:12:27,011
look up the word w.

1094
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:31,474
We need to take the intersection

1095
01:12:31,474 --> 01:12:33,840
of the set of possible neighbors.

1096
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:40,171
We take the set intersection...

1097
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,817
SP: Is it bang or double-bang for the
lookup operator? I can't remember.

1098
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:47,165
OC: From map I believe
it's just a single exclamation mark,

1099
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,520
whereas for lists it's two exclamation marks.

1100
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:58,020
So we don't seem to have any compile errors

1101
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,850
around this neighbours function.

1102
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,250
That's quite straightforward.

1103
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,440
We also need a way to precomputeNeighbours.

1104
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:11,817
So that takes the
dictionary and turns it into a NeighbourMap,

1105
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,540
SP: So here your
starting from saying; from right down

1106
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,594
in the lowest level of this computation

1107
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,622
you would like to have
that extra information available

1108
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:24,857
in that NeighbourMap and you're
working your way back up

1109
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:27,340
to the calling levels

1110
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,340
to see how to pass that down into it.

1111
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:34,325
OC: Yes. We've got a neighbours function.

1112
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,622
I would like to be able to test that in GHCi

1113
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,862
but we don't have a way
to build a NeighbourMap yet.

1114
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,937
So I'm going to work on this
precomputeNeighbours function

1115
01:13:41,937 --> 01:13:43,794
then I can have a test from GHCi

1116
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,022
so I can actually see if

1117
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,262
the NeighbourMap seems to
be working as we would expect.

1118
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,011
Then we can work
through the rest of the compile errors

1119
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:54,370
And thread in the proper code as we need to.

1120
01:13:55,777 --> 01:13:57,902
So this looks like it
should be straightforward,

1121
01:13:57,902 --> 01:14:02,194
we just take our
dictionary, which is a set of words,

1122
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:04,800
so if we go from set to list.

1123
01:14:05,885 --> 01:14:10,354
and for every word
in here we can map over...

1124
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,005
Ah! We did need our
original neighbours function

1125
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,142
which I have thrown away now (laughter)

1126
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,914
because we want to use that.

1127
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,620
OC: So let's see if I can go back to that.

1128
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:27,942
So I'll call this one...

1129
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:32,908
neighboursLookup.

1130
01:14:37,748 --> 01:14:41,320
And this is back to how it was.

1131
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:57,422
SP: We could also call this
neighbours and have the old

1132
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,680
neighbours function
simply be a function returning

1133
01:15:01,685 --> 01:15:05,171
a list of the words
with the neighbors and distances.

1134
01:15:06,388 --> 01:15:08,337
OC: In the neighbours function or...?

1135
01:15:09,257 --> 01:15:12,685
SP: Yes, so you could - at this level here

1136
01:15:12,685 --> 01:15:15,742
where your returning W with distance,

1137
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:22,177
in order to avoid having two similarly named functions.

1138
01:15:22,348 --> 01:15:23,994
Maybe we should continue...

1139
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:25,740
OC: It's probably worth renaming this though

1140
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,194
because we want compile error,

1141
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:30,140
we're going to get compile
errors anyway because the types are different.

1142
01:15:34,165 --> 01:15:38,417
I'm going to move this
into precomputeNeighbours,

1143
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,474
as a where binding

1144
01:15:39,485 --> 01:15:42,110
because we don't
have any reason to ever call this

1145
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,988
other than inside precomputeNeighbours.

1146
01:15:48,451 --> 01:15:50,450
SP: And it does mean
you can rename the top level.

1147
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,822
OC: Exactly.

1148
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:56,457
The dictionary is going
to be available up here anyway,

1149
01:16:00,937 --> 01:16:05,731
We need to turn our
dictionary into a list of words

1150
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:10,165
and map neighbors over that.

1151
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:16,382
So I need to pair them up
with the original word as well.

1152
01:16:17,982 --> 01:16:21,371
There's a fairly nice function
in the Control.Arrow module

1153
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,257
which lets us run two
functions on the same argument.

1154
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,668
I can say that id and neighbors,

1155
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:33,110
so that's the identity
function and the neighbors function

1156
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,497
and it's going to tuple those up for me.

1157
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:36,285
SP: OK.

1158
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,970
OC: I think I'll just import that...

1159
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:44,497
We've got a lot of compile errors.

1160
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:17,377
We apparently need the word A as well.

1161
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:28,200
I think that's meant to be...
Oh, I must have originally called it A.

1162
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:33,880
OC: So now we have
precomputeNeighbours but that's

1163
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,050
not returning the neighbors now.

1164
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,177
We don't really need to keep dict...
Oh we do

1165
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,342
because were using that in neighbors

1166
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:52,110
Now this is going to be a list of tuples.

1167
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:54,257
OC: We can turn that into a map.

1168
01:17:58,537 --> 01:18:01,485
So we've turned our
dictionary into a list of text

1169
01:18:01,788 --> 01:18:04,251
and for every text value we turn that into

1170
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:06,154
the text word itself

1171
01:18:06,154 --> 01:18:08,965
and its set of neighbors.

1172
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:11,651
SP: And each word will
be distinct so you don't need

1173
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:14,634
to worry about combining entries.

1174
01:18:14,634 --> 01:18:15,485
OC: Right, yes

1175
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:19,657
OC: Let's see what we get from that.

1176
01:18:23,502 --> 01:18:27,805
neighbors is going to
be neighboursLookup,

1177
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:33,805
so that's... well, yes
let's keep it as neighboursLookup.

1178
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,537
OC: I'm just checking that's
the only compile error we've got,

1179
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:44,188
and it looks like it is,

1180
01:18:44,188 --> 01:18:46,622
so we've just got two arrows up here.

1181
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,691
That means expand rather
than just take the dictionary.

1182
01:18:49,697 --> 01:18:52,730
This also need to take a NeighbourMap.

1183
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,240
The order here is dictionary, NeighbourMap.

1184
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,650
I just had a thought there,

1185
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:15,000
because we're always
passing these two things together maybe

1186
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,520
I should be combining these.

1187
01:19:16,702 --> 01:19:18,657
SP: I was having the same thought.

1188
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:20,600
OC: So I think maybe our NeighbourMap

1189
01:19:20,605 --> 01:19:24,325
could be a data type
containing the full pre-computed map,

1190
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,240
but also a set of exclusions.

1191
01:19:27,245 --> 01:19:29,510
And every time we need
to drop something out of the

1192
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,405
NeighbourMap we can
do that quite efficiently.

1193
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:36,182
OC: Or we may not even need to carry
the dictionary around but we'll see.

1194
01:19:36,182 --> 01:19:37,651
I'll come back to that later.

1195
01:19:38,062 --> 01:19:40,634
but it certainly does feel suspect so far.

1196
01:19:42,805 --> 01:19:46,508
So I think I better put
this the right way round

1197
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,565
it's dictionary and NeighbourMap

1198
01:19:50,188 --> 01:19:52,588
This is the dictionary and NeighbourMap

1199
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:02,340
and now expand
needs that NeighbourMap as well.

1200
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:08,034
But interestingly, this
doesn't have to be added to go.

1201
01:20:08,034 --> 01:20:10,370
Because the NeighbourMap doesn't ever change

1202
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:14,640
from what we've got so
far. So that's just a constant.

1203
01:20:20,925 --> 01:20:22,600
SP: You could underscore it in the first one.

1204
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:23,988
OC: Indeed, yes.

1205
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,297
And, we need to call that recursively.

1206
01:20:36,262 --> 01:20:38,554
and we need to pass it in here as well.

1207
01:20:39,028 --> 01:20:43,200
So here, I think I'll use another let binding.

1208
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:03,137
So now our word puzzle should
be using this precomputed NeighbourMap.

1209
01:21:03,154 --> 01:21:03,937

SP: Right.

1210
01:21:04,091 --> 01:21:07,222
And were using our more
efficient neighbors look-up function.

1211
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,931
So hopefully...

1212
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,594
we are going to see some results.

1213
01:21:10,594 --> 01:21:12,965
Impressively its still
trying to find solutions between

1214
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,925
house and shout, on the old code.

1215
01:21:16,548 --> 01:21:19,880
So let's see what we get out of this.

1216
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:24,942
We didn't really look
at seeing precomputeNeighbours work, so

1217
01:21:24,942 --> 01:21:30,577
let's have a quick look at that.

1218
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:40,845
OK, so that certainly type checks.

1219
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,800
Let's bind that to... something like that.

1220
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,862
We can do nMap...

1221
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,908
SP: Jellow and hells. (laughter).

1222
01:21:57,234 --> 01:21:59,420
OC: So precomputeNeighbours seems to be working.

1223
01:21:59,428 --> 01:22:01,510
We seem to be getting some actual neighbors,

1224
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:05,860
so let's do ruby and code again.

1225
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:11,628
It doesn't seem to
be a huge amount more efficient

1226
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:17,142
But maybe we'll actually
get a result from this now

1227
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,114
We've still got a little bit to go.

1228
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,228
SP: Does it take long
to pre-compute the entire map?

1229
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:36,480
can you force that computation and see?

1230
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:39,382
OC: We can try forcing
that and see what happens.

1231
01:22:42,034 --> 01:22:44,840
SP: And of course here your
going to be pre-computing the neighbors

1232
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,268
across the full dictionary,

1233
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,834
not necessarily the dictionary
pruned down to only the the words

1234
01:22:51,902 --> 01:22:53,200
of the length we're interested in.

1235
01:22:53,571 --> 01:22:57,234
OC: Yes that's probably worth doing already.

1236
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,897
Rather than precomputing
the dictionary of everything.

1237
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:04,165
Though we're using a lazy map
here which means that

1238
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:09,148
we'll get a map back that
contains all of the words as keys,

1239
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,862
but the values underneath
that map won't be fully evaluated.

1240
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:15,594
So it's only when we
look up those keys in the map

1241
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,588
that we will do that work.

1242
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,760
So hopefully having the full dictionary
in there doesn't make any difference.

1243
01:23:21,771 --> 01:23:26,262
But I think for clarity
that's slightly nicer if we

1244
01:23:26,262 --> 01:23:35,445
just say filter, length, equal to length of A.

1245
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:40,194
SP: Of course, this way your run length across...

1246
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:42,228
is it hundreds of thousands of words?

1247
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,222
OC: Yes.

1248
01:23:44,777 --> 01:23:46,171
SP: So its a tradeoff.

1249
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,194
OC. So we take the length...

1250
01:24:12,234 --> 01:24:15,331
I think that's
because we have text values here.

1251
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:19,285
We've already seen this
type of function before anyway.

1252
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:24,708
We still have it down here.

1253
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:26,700
Maybe we could do something with that.

1254
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,850
Maybe neighbors now
doesn't have to worry about that,

1255
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:34,108
we've already done that once.

1256
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,280
I think I'll just leave that duplication for now,
and see if that

1257
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,565
has made a difference.

1258
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:46,742
It seems a bit snappier doesn't it?
SP: Yes

1259
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,462
SP: So the acid test. (laughter).

1260
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:59,834
There's still no results
between house and shout.

1261
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,942
SP: So that's great, we've reached a point now

1262
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:09,251
were we're able to
find chains quite efficiently,

1263
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:15,066
Not just from cat to dog
but also from ruby to code.

1264
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:20,146
SP: Where do you think
you would go next with this?

1265
01:25:20,413 --> 01:25:25,680
OC: One thing that's always been sticking with
me quite a bit is

1266
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,640
in go we are using ++,

1267
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,680
which means that
because were always having

1268
01:25:32,706 --> 01:25:33,920
to put things on the end of the list.

1269
01:25:33,933 --> 01:25:35,733
We're always have to
walk through the start of the list

1270
01:25:35,733 --> 01:25:38,733
to get to the end. And we're
having to do that repeatedly.

1271
01:25:38,906 --> 01:25:41,573
There's a couple of
well known ways we can go about

1272
01:25:41,586 --> 01:25:43,310
optimising that at Haskell.

1273
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,786
Difference lists are one possibility.

1274
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:50,346
Which means that
appending has much less of a cost

1275
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:53,720
provided we don't ever try
to inspect the front early on

1276
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:55,186
but we don't need to do that, we only need

1277
01:25:55,186 --> 01:25:57,986
to start inspecting once
we've built up this big computation

1278
01:25:58,013 --> 01:26:00,160
of all possible solutions, and then we can

1279
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,133
start pulling things off the front.

1280
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:04,280
So that could be
an interesting optimization to see.

1281
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,693
That maybe we'll be able to
allocate a bit less in the go function.

1282
01:26:08,693 --> 01:26:12,133
Beyond that I'd probably want
to look at doing some code profiling.

1283
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,386
Try and work out if maybe something is being

1284
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:15,920
hit a little too frequently.

1285
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,453
And see if we can do something there.

1286
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,933
Obvious strategies in
any graph search problem

1287
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,866
would be memoisation.

1288
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:28,085
Which works really nicely at Haskell.

1289
01:26:28,085 --> 01:26:29,885
That wouldn't be too hard to add in.

1290
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:33,457
It's just a case of working out
exactly what needs to be optimised.

1291
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,440
And a couple of other things.

1292
01:26:35,453 --> 01:26:37,466
Just in terms of the feel of this code,

1293
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:38,740
that I'd want to clean up.

1294
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,971
As I pointed out earlier, the NeighbourMap

1295
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,106
always has to be paired
with the dictionary, so forcing

1296
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,413
the user to pass the dictionary
and the NeighbourMap around,

1297
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:47,986
felt a bit cumbersome.

1298
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:51,880
It would be nice if we could work
out some sort of abstraction there.

1299
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,293
A NeighbourMap data type that has an operation

1300
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,680
like look-up and remove.

1301
01:26:56,693 --> 01:27:00,800
SP: Or the dictionary itself is more complex

1302
01:27:00,813 --> 01:27:05,666
and opaque structure which
can provide you with neighbors.

1303
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,106
OC: Absolutely,

1304
01:27:07,106 --> 01:27:09,026
SP:  Because that's the only operation

1305
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:09,840
we have on the [inaudible]

1306
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:12,370
OC: Yes, it needs
efficient look up and efficient

1307
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:14,400
removal of the things you've already seen.

1308
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:17,840
Beyond that, we don't
have any other requirements.

1309
01:27:17,973 --> 01:27:22,560
I think were moved it to a Set...

1310
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,360
we did yes.

1311
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:27,893
so Set does have
efficient look up and deletion.

1312
01:27:27,893 --> 01:27:32,520
But if we were able to combine that with

1313
01:27:32,546 --> 01:27:34,026
the pre-computed NeighbourMap

1314
01:27:34,026 --> 01:27:36,466
we would probably get a much nicer API.

1315
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:38,013
SP: And having worked through this,

1316
01:27:38,013 --> 01:27:42,600
the overall approach of using
lists to represent the word chains

1317
01:27:42,613 --> 01:27:46,080
and  expanding those lists.

1318
01:27:48,493 --> 01:27:51,040
Is that the approach you would use again?

1319
01:27:51,173 --> 01:27:53,440
OC: I think, now that we've got more familiar with

1320
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,920
the problem, and it's clear
that it has this tree structure

1321
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,786
and you're doing a breadth-first search.

1322
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,426
It would have been
nice to make that explicit

1323
01:27:59,426 --> 01:28:00,720
in the types themselves.

1324
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,560
So use some sort of tree structure
to represent the branching out,

1325
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,360
because I think a couple of
times we've confused ourselves

1326
01:28:07,386 --> 01:28:10,400
with lists of lists of text,
when we actually wanted

1327
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,142
a list of texts, and it was unclear

1328
01:28:12,142 --> 01:28:13,657
how we actually got from

1329
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:15,813
that nested list to a single list.

1330
01:28:15,826 --> 01:28:18,040
Was concat the
right operation to be using

1331
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,853
or have we made a
mistake somewhere else.

1332
01:28:20,853 --> 01:28:22,973
So we didn't really lean on the types there,

1333
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,013
it would have  been nice if we could have taken more

1334
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:27,110
advantage from the type system.

1335
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:30,666
I think if I were to do
it again I would choose

1336
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:33,306
a slightly better data structure for word chains

1337
01:28:33,306 --> 01:28:34,080
in the first place.

1338
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,773
SP: So there's a built in tree type, isn't there, there?

1339
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,986
OC: Yes, its not one
that I'm very familiar with.

1340
01:28:39,986 --> 01:28:42,906
It's in the same library
as Data.Set and Data.Map.

1341
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:45,613
It doesn't have a hugh API,

1342
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:48,893
but it does avoid me reinventing the wheel in terms of

1343
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,857
just coming up with the data type.

1344
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,050
And the other thing
that I might be interested in doing

1345
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,266
there's a lot of hidden recursion here.

1346
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,080
It's quite hard to follow this code,

1347
01:29:00,093 --> 01:29:01,973
it calls itself in different ways.

1348
01:29:03,066 --> 01:29:07,266
It's more of an advanced way of writing Haskell

1349
01:29:07,266 --> 01:29:09,320
but you can
split that recursion out

1350
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,293
and make it very explicit.

1351
01:29:10,293 --> 01:29:13,266
So you pass around functions
that operate on just one thing,

1352
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:15,906
and then you have a recursion scheme you can apply to that.

1353
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,960
And that might come out
with some slightly cleaner code,

1354
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:22,706
but it's going to take a
lot more work to get that.

1355
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,226
But I think making that recursion clear

1356
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,960
could clear up a lot of this code.

1357
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,293
SP: Right, that seems like a successful session.

1358
01:29:31,293 --> 01:29:32,973
OC: I think so - got there in the end.

1359
01:29:32,973 --> 01:29:36,226
SP: Yes, thanks.

1360
01:29:36,226 --> 01:29:36,880
OC: OK.
