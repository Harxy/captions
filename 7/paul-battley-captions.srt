NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:06,776
where you can hone your skills
by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:10,424
Our guest today is Paul Battley.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,120
Who is a veteran Ruby developer, 

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,824
who has worked with agencies,
startups and Government departments.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,248
Our host is Jamie White, and the
challenge that he has set for Paul is called

7
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:24,128
Encoding Images As Quad Trees.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:30,384
Jamie White: OK, so how about
we start by reading the challenge?

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,224
Paul Battley: OK, so... 

10
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:37,992
Write a program to convert a given binary
image into a quad tree and serialize it to disk.

11
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:43,352
Write another program to take a
serialized quad tree and turn it back into an image.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,608
The quad tree for an image is generated
by splitting the image into four quadrants

13
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:51,152
then successively splitting each
of these into further quadrants.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,952
When a quadrant consists of a single
color, it may be considered a terminal node.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,880
JW: I have provided this beautiful
binary image for you to work with.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,616
PB: Not quite the right time,
depending on when your watching this.

17
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:10,656
JW: It's in a Windows 1Bit Bitmap format.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,048
So, it's up to you how you make use of that.
