00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,272
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,920
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,376
Our guest today is Amy Wagner,
who is an independent Agile coach and consultant.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,656
And a co-author of the Minimum Viable book.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,128
Amys' client today is Anna Bowers,
who's a product manager at Dorling Kindersley,

6
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:22,448
an international publishers.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
Anna is managing the
development of a new digital product,

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,968
which has lots of different
stakeholders and a new development team.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Her company is used to sharing
physical products on a fixed timetable.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,080
For this new digital product, they're
interested in adopting a more agile methodology 

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,640
and they're keen to get some coaching from Amy.

12
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,632
In this Peer to Peer session, we'll
see how Amy coaches a client on a new project.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,608
She'll work through 3 Agile techniques
that she felt were appropriate in this case:

14
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:57,600
the Spine, Inception, and Impact Mapping.

15
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,552
[Chapter 1]

16
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,088
AMY WAGNER: So Anna maybe you
can tell us a little bit about your product.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:09,856
ANNA BOWERS: Yes, so I work
for a publisher based in the UK.

18
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,568
And I sit on the web team as a product manager.

19
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:18,832
And we're just about to
kick off an exciting new product.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,904
And we've done about 3 or 4 months of
discovery work, and we're looking to get into sprint.

21
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:30,672
It's going to be an online learning tool.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,456
It started with a print element and we're
going to take some of that and put it online,

23
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,688
so there's a digital element:
and that's the bit I'm working on.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,480
It consists of a course book
and some practice books.

25
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,704
We need to host audio files
that go with the course book online

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,648
And we also need to put
some practice exercises online.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,448
And potentially monetize
them and create user accounts.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,984
And track progress of the users.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,672
AW: If you were to describe your
product in one sentence... how would you do that?

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,088
AB: Alright, let me have a go.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,968
So it's an online self study tool for adult learners...

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,544
that let's them track their progress.

33
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,460
[New Chapter]

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,712
AW: Right, so Anna, let's
do an exercise called the spine.

35
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:39,808
The spine is something that you should
be doing with your team and your stakeholders
