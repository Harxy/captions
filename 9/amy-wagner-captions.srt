00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,272
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,920
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,376
Our guest today is Amy Wagner,
who is an independent Agile coach and consultant.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,656
And a co-author of the Minimum Viable book.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,128
Amys' client today is Anna Bowers,
who's a product manager at Dorling Kindersley,

6
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:22,448
an international publishers.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
Anna is managing the
development of a new digital product,

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,968
which has lots of different
stakeholders and a new development team.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Her company is used to sharing
physical products on a fixed timetable.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,080
For this new digital product, they're
interested in adopting a more agile methodology

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,640
and they're keen to get some coaching from Amy.

12
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,632
In this Peer to Peer session, we'll
see how Amy coaches a client on a new project.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,608
She'll work through 3 Agile techniques
that she felt were appropriate in this case:

14
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:57,600
the Spine, Inception, and Impact Mapping.

15
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,552
[Chapter 1]

16
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,088
AMY WAGNER: So Anna maybe you
can tell us a little bit about your product.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:09,856
ANNA BOWERS: Yes, so I work
for a publisher based in the UK.

18
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,568
And I sit on the web team as a product manager.

19
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:18,832
And we're just about to
kick off an exciting new product.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,904
And we've done about 3 or 4 months of
discovery work, and we're looking to get into sprint.

21
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:30,672
It's going to be an online learning tool.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,456
It started with a print element and we're
going to take some of that and put it online,

23
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,688
so there's a digital element:
and that's the bit I'm working on.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,480
It consists of a course book
and some practice books.

25
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,704
We need to host audio files
that go with the course book online

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,648
And we also need to put
some practice exercises online.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,448
And potentially monetize
them and create user accounts.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,984
And track progress of the users.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,672
AW: If you were to describe your
product in one sentence... how would you do that?

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,088
AB: Alright, let me have a go.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,968
So it's an online self study tool for adult learners...

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,544
that let's them track their progress.

33
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,460
[New Chapter]

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,712
AW: Right, so Anna, let's
do an exercise called the spine.

35
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:39,808
The spine is something that you should
be doing with your team and your stakeholders

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,968
So we're going to run through it together now...

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
AB: So that I can take it away.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,184
AW: Yes, exactly, so we can practice
the technique and you can take it away.

39
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:55,952
So we will to start with two minutes of individual
ideas that come to you about the product.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,680
So one idea per poster note, and single
words or very short sentences if you can,

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,960
to describe the product... the kind
of tone... maybe to describe what it's doing,

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,456
what problems it might be solving for the user.

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,960
I don't want to give you any more guidance than
that because I want to see what you come up with.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's do that now. I'll hand you this.

45
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:24,780
AB: Sticky notes.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:33,488
AW: Yes. OK so as many ideas as you
can muster, one per 'post it' note... two minutes.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,264
Let's go. AB: OK.

48
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:43,904
AB: Alright, so the fist one is
that it's an online learning tool.

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,448
That's what it is in the basic sense.

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,544
It gives a sense of progression for anyone using it.

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,136
It's got a professional tone

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:01,984
It's got a visual tone as well, because
the company is aesthetic, it's very visual.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,112
So there are a lot of bright images,
and things like that, to help with online learning.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:16,224
And it's self-led as well, so it's instructional
but it's for people to use without a teacher.

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,576
AW: Nice... I like it.

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:26,624
Good, so at this point, if we were doing this
exercise with your stakeholders and your team,

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:36,320
We would go round one by one to everyone
in the room (ideally not more than about 10 people),

58
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:43,808
and explain to the group the reasons for
why they did it, exactly like you just did it then.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,832
And once everyone has gone
round and explained their 'post it' notes

60
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,008
So what we do then is cluster.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,152
AB: Yes, and hopefully
there will be lots of similar ideas.

62
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,088
AW: Yes, that's the idea... you reach
a kind of alignment through clustering.

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,872
Someone might say self-led and someone else
might say something like self leading [laughter].

64
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,040
Are there any here that you think
look similar? No they all look different.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,144
There are inaud things...

66
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:27,472
Right, so let's say we've got
some others that are clustered here.

67
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,432
I've put my ideas down in inaud

68
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:42,960
Typically you get a bigger cluster on a
certain few of them, and others become outliers.

69
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,272
And they are the ones that only a couple
of people, or only one person has thought about.

70
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,608
And then it's quite easy to
see where popular opinion lies.

71
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,784
Typically at that point we also do a little bit of inaud.

72
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,816
I'm going to give you some stickers.
My favorites at the moment are stars: you can use any.

73
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,672
If you don't have any stickers...
AB: Buy some! AW: Yes. [laughter].

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,016
Or you can give everyone a different
color pen, and get them to vote on something

75
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:23,136
by just putting a little dot on these.

76
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:31,232
What I would normally do is give people...
definitely less votes per number of clusters.

77
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:34,352
That forces you to prioritize.

78
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,240
In fact, you can see that
I'm giving you three stars there.

79
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:45,296
And the other thing that I ask
people to do is to use their stickers

80
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:54,352
to indicate what they think is the most important,
and so you can vote on something twice in that case.

81
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,320
[They both talk at once]

82
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:02,912
You can put an even spread,
whatever makes sense to you.

83
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,984
So go ahead and vote and maybe
you can talk us through while your doing it.

84
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,648
AB: That's really what the product is.

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,720
If you didn't have any of those
that would still be the product.

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I might even put another one on there.

87
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:20,656
AW: Oh no you'll have to take some of the others off!

88
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,608
AB: It's quite difficult...
I'm going to go self led as well.

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,544
I would put one on visual if I could too.

90
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,048
But you've only got three.

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,192
So are you happy with that? AB: Yes, I am.

92
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,792
AW: That really does help you to
weed it out doesn't it? AB: It does.

93
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,672
AW: So this one is the winner, it got two votes.

94
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,352
This has got one vote.

95
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,760
And these are outliers.

96
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:57,104
If it was a whole group of people, and these got
no votes I'd put them completely out of the picture.

97
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,312
I would say "OK, let's not
think about that for the moment".

98
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,216
But because it's us, and you've got a bit of an
overview, and we're just doing this as an example,

99
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,832
we'll bring these back in.

100
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:18,016
The next bit is sometimes the most difficult bit,
but where you get the real output from the exercise.

101
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,016
And that's where we construct
the single sentence description,

102
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,264
or the spine, of what we're talking about.

103
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:35,824
Using these key words, let's see if they match
back to what you said earlier about the product.

104
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,168
Normally I start out like
this if I'm facilitating a session.

105
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,528
I would say... like a basic starting point.

106
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,208
If we take some of these and
try to construct this sentence.

107
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,992
It doesn't matter if you don't use all of these,
but it would be nice to leave them in somewhere,

108
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,976
because, let's imagine if we've
got all the stakeholders in the room,

109
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,480
We've just got this top 5 list of words, and we want
to try and add them to the sentence at this point.

110
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,488
We want them to form part of the final product.

111
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,680
So let me just start you off.

112
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:26,970
We are building an online learning tool.

113
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:41,936
It is self led and professional.

114
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,560
AB: And is visual... for progression.

115
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
AW: For progression of?
I'll let you finish the rest of that.

116
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,504
AB: Well yes, this is for the user needs.

117
00:09:57,216 --> 00:10:07,664
So it is progression for
personal or professional lives.

118
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,320
AW: We can put that down here then and move that there.

119
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,936
Its probably good to remember, that it might be
easy for you to do in isolation, but with a few people...

120
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:28,944
AB: Yes, but if you have a controversial one that not
everyone agrees with, how would you deal with that?

121
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,912
AW: I think it's important to let
people communicate why they want that.

122
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,272
There is also a kind of secret
goal of doing a session like this,

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:45,792
We're trying to align everyone in the
room, and get anything controversial out of the way.

124
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:56,608
And I think a single sentence is one artifact
that comes out of quite a lot of communication.

125
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,808
And a lot of alignment that
happens in the room on the day.

126
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,416
This just reminds you that everyone is on the
same page, if you come back to this again and again.

127
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,648
So that's the spine... do you remember
what you described at the start of the session?

128
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,320
No it would be really interesting to... learning tool.

129
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:24,880
I guess it doesn't really matter because
what I want you to do is take this away

130
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:33,720
and get those people in a room that have strong
opinions about what this product should be.

131
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:41,640
Maybe they're the ones that need to
hit the revenue target within the organization.

132
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,208
Get them to input using an exercise like this.

133
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,648
See if that comes back to where you are.

134
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,600
AB: I know, I'm going to take a photo of this
and see how close we can get to it next week.

135
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,400
AW: And if it's completely
different, maybe that's OK too.

136
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,512
Good, so that's the spine.

137
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,800
[New Chapter]

138
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,920
AW: So here's one for you that you might
want to run when you've got the team together,

139
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,136
and you're thinking what now and you
want to brief them about what's going on.

140
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,208
You want to get any concerns about how
this might be running out in the open at the start.

141
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,344
AB: Sounds good.

142
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:34,432
AW: So normally the focus for this...
and this is called the inception by the way.

143
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:42,560
You often find that people in GS use this,
and Jamie Arnold, runs these things with his team.

144
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,656
Lots of people will run an inception
when you're about to kick off a product.

145
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,536
AB: I think I really need to do that in my kick off.

146
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,800
AW: It's a nice way to get
everyone together and work through it.

147
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,216
So an inception normally
has these other lists to it.

148
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:07,920
Before we finish we're going to see if we can
come up with some mitigation for these fears too.

149
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,944
So again it's a post up exercise, everyone has post it notes.

150
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:21,900
And the first thing that you get everyone to
think about is "What's driving us to do this product?"

151
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,752
"What's driving the organization to do
this product and what do we need from it?"

152
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,512
So I think we should do
a couple of ideas, just talking,

153
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,208
rather than you going off
and thinking about it at this time.

154
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,288
So anything that comes to mind
about why we're building this online learning tool?

155
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,240
AB: There is potential, market potential.

156
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,736
AW: So is that revenue, or just getting
the users from one or the other or both?

157
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,440
AB: I think immediately there's a market
share potential and then a revenue potential.

158
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,912
Yes, there's a lot of research
that says online learning is growing.

159
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,840
AW: Yes! so there's a clear opportunity there.

160
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,520
So market share, revenue, clear opportunity.

161
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:33,184
At this point we would ask everyone in the team to
put theirs up on the wall too and talk them through.

162
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,592
AB: Yes, there's a lot of research that
goes into those two before hand, in discoverys,

163
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:41,184
so there would probably be a
lot of discussion around from the drivers.

164
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,352
AW: So if you have already done your spine,

165
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,976
this is normally where you present the spine,
or some of the work that's been done previously,

166
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,760
so everyone would understand these on the wall here.

167
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:05,264
And I think also, if you get a lot of
drivers on the wall, not just these few main ones,

168
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,560
a little bit of dot voting as well, like
we did in the inception so getting everyone to...

169
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,552
AB: What is a good number of drivers then?

170
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,392
AW: I wouldn't put a rule on something like this...

171
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,904
AB: But you can have loads, yes?

172
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,392
AW: If you have loads, it's nice to know
if one is more important than the others.

173
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,928
AB: So you can have loads,
but you need to prioritize them.

174
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,432
AW: Exactly.

175
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,168
Because there's a difference
here [they both talk at once]

176
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,936
AB: They may become different... in time

177
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,680
AB: Yes, so one of them is more
important now, one is more important in the future.

178
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,064
AW: So if you were to prioritize
these two now, would it be this way?

179
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,448
AB: Yes.

180
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,624
AW: So this is number one.

181
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,688
And this is number two.

182
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,136
AB: I don't know what my
manager will say about that. [laughter]

183
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,400
I think that's right.

184
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:01,328
AW: A lot of products go for users first, registrations first, inaud later.

185
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,928
And try and get inaud

186
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,896
AB: Yes, you said it, we heard it inaud.

187
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,448
AW: Anyway, so  that's how you would prioritize it inaud.

188
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,136
There you go, you've been quit inaud with your drivers... accidentally

189
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:23,408
Accidentally, on purpose. [laughter]

190
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,512
OK, so let's say the whole team have done their drivers,

191
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,512
and everyone's had a discussion about that.

192
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,576
And do you know what
happens accidentally during this process?

193
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:40,704
Accidentally, you have also communicated
to everybody that this is more important than that.

194
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,568
And everyone's on exactly the same page. 

195
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,408
You can have an artifact later
to say [they both talk at once].

196
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,672
Remember when you said market
share was more important than revenue?

197
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,376
Well that is the case for the first
6 months, or whatever context was there.

198
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:04,800
OK, how about hopes. What are your hopes
for the product... and this can be personal, as well.

199
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,408
This can be, like... success based metrics.

200
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:24,576
OK, so you want a well received
product. What does that mean, awards or...

201
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,472
AB: I think you could spin off awards from that.

202
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,912
I would like user testing to
come back with lots of positives.

203
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:42,368
For it to make changes to peoples
lives, so they achieve their goals.

204
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:46,128
Those things are quite hard to measure I suppose.

205
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I want it to be well designed and well
thought through, those are the hopes.

206
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,296
And how do you measure well designed,
what's your perception of 'well designed'?

207
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,224
AB: Well it goes back to one of the
principles, but I cant remember which one.

208
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,584
AW: Oh it would be continuous attention to technical and inaud.

209
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,464
Design excellence.

210
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,744
AB: Yes, just keeping an eye on things
like technical debt and making sure...

211
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,192
AW: So design in terms of
technical aspect as well, right, good.

212
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:29,200
AW: And the way the team works together
as well, would you want that to be one of them?

213
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,664
From your career... its OK to
say these things and then inception...

214
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,048
AB: Yes, I want a happy team.

215
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,832
I want a happy team that has continuous learning.

216
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,830
AW: Nice.

217
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,664
AB: Yes, so these are some goals.

218
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,216
AW: OK great, I think that's good for now.

219
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,280
And again what we normally do in
inception when the whole team are here... 

220
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,400
you would go round the room...
and so you would have lots of...

221
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,888
You would end up seeing clusters of similar as well.

222
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,168
And then you can ask anyone who is
coming along to then go, OK well that's similar 

223
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:17,600
to what Anna said, so we'll put
that together and that becomes a cluster

224
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,408
which is about design excellence
or well designed options - that kind of thing.

225
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,752
And again it would be nice to
dot vote as well. [they both talk at once]

226
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,120
It might be that this is more important than this

227
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,176
because usually these things make
these things happen with a happy team.

228
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,472
That's the most important,
 it goes well beyond most things.

229
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:55,312
So then you would end up with your order of priority.

230
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:59,248
So let's say we've dot voted and this has come out number 1,

231
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,904
this has come out number two,

232
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,680
and this is number 3.

233
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,384
Circulate that, put it on the wall in
your teams area, anything that that your fearful of

234
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:15,180
kicking this product off.

235
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:21,424
AB: OK if it fails, I mean there's lots
of different ways of describing failure

236
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:30,016
but 'fails' is badly received I
think - I've got well received there

237
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:34,608
Badly received. AW: Yes.

238
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:41,840
Here's a thing, just a quick tangent; it would be nice
to know this sooner rather that later wouldn't it?

239
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,536
AB: Like at the beginning. AW: Yes.

240
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,272
So the sooner you can test this the better; the approach you're going for.

241
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,632
AB: Yes, with early testing.

242
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:59,184
Other fears - that it breaks.

243
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:08,208
AW: So when you say break do you mean things like inaud, poor user experience...

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,120
that sort of thing?

245
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,072
AB: I mean that sort of thing.

246
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,152
AW: You can have poor user experience
with that as well but still, I guess that's an idea.

247
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,600
AB: We could go massively over budget.

248
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,032
We could run out of time.

249
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,248
We could miss our market opportunity.

250
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,016
There are lots of things, but there's a few.

251
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,336
AW: So do you have a specific time frame in mind?

252
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,840
AB: Yes

253
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
AW: So what are you thinking about.

254
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,032
AB: We're aiming for June 2016.

255
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,920
AW: So just under a year.

256
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,240
And what about a budget,
do you have a specific budget.

257
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,976
AB: We do yes, and we can't go over that.

258
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,808
AW: So that's like - this is the maximum possible.

259
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:20,800
And so if you get half way and you burned through
that entire budget that's not going to be good.

260
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,808
AB: But like you were saying, if you
can measure all of these as early as possible 

261
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,480
then you can mitigate them. AW: Exactly.

262
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:38,496
So that's the next thing - to look at
all the fears individually and to mitigate them.

263
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,336
And we'll just rush through this
really quickly because this is the stuff 

264
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:47,104
you really should be doing with the
team once you understand the technique.

265
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,328
Is there anything you can do to sort of control this?

266
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,792
AB: Yes, user testing would help a lot.

267
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:03,296
AW: And release as early as possible so
you know you're going down the right path.

268
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,728
So early releases, and that
term, minimal viable product.

269
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,896
I've heard that one before, maybe from that book inaud startup.

270
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,664
That helps you narrow in on
something early, that you can test early,

271
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,560
and get it out the door, and see
if it's worth taking that approach,

272
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,512
before you invest too much time into
it, whatever that approach might be.

273
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:35,408
Let's think about what we
can do to mitigate it 'breaking'.

274
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,096
AB: Yes, data loss and things like that... testing.

275
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,456
User acceptance testing,
regression testing... all the testing.

276
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:52,960
With a list of best practices
so we can have a standard.

277
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
Early on as well, hopefully.

278
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,464
And I found that it's good to get as
many people as possible working on the project

279
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:07,260
doing all of these things, rather
than just one person doing it all.

280
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,328
AW: And other things that software
development teams are doing a lot of lately

281
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:17,536
is test driven development...
so writing tests before features.

282
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,792
And also developers are owning their tests, not
just passing it on to the person who owns testing.

283
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,784
inaud launching it over the fence to someone else who can think about testing.

284
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,032
AB: Yes, I'm not a massive fan
of everyone having a go at that.

285
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,064
AW: Budgets.

286
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:46,624
AB: Yes, erm... we've done a few similar
projects, so I think we've got a good budget estimate

287
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:54,080
That is a fear, but I think we've mitigated
it already by using other products as a template.

288
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:59,888
So you've seen how some of the
other products...[they both talk at once]

289
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,712
AB: So using past learning.

290
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,584
AW: Past learning, that's a great
one, and was that with the same team?

291
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,224
AB: Yes.

292
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:15,216
AW: Well that's great because that's a bit of an
unknown if you're setting up with a new product team.

293
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,184
But since your using an established
product team within your organization...

294
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:28,352
AB: And with that one as well, we
do quite a lot of comparative testing. 

295
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:32,464
if we want to use a new bit of
software, or if we want a new component, 

296
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,512
we look at different ways of achieving
that and balance benefit against cost.

297
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,232
AW: Cost benefit analysis.

298
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,504
AB: Definitely. So yes, that's
how we would mitigate that.

299
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,576
AW: Running out of time.

300
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,800
AB: We just cant run out of time, that's it!

301
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,200
This comes back to one of the
big fears I have about this project, 

302
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:03,248
which is over-promising on spring deliveries.

303
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,704
So managing the expectations
and the work capacity of of a sprint

304
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,632
will be integral in not running out of time and
working out how much we can realistically deliver.
