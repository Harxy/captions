00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,272
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,920
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,376
Our guest today is Amy Wagner,
who is an independent Agile coach and consultant.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,656
And a co-author of the Minimum Viable book.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,128
Amys' client today is Anna Bowers,
who's a product manager at Dorling Kindersley,

6
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:22,448
an international publishers.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
Anna is managing the
development of a new digital product,

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,968
which has lots of different
stakeholders and a new development team.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Her company is used to sharing
physical products on a fixed timetable.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,080
For this new digital product, they're
interested in adopting a more agile methodology 

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,640
and they're keen to get some coaching from Amy.

12
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,632
In this Peer to Peer session, we'll
see how Amy coaches a client on a new project.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,608
She'll work through 3 Agile techniques
that she felt were appropriate in this case:

14
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:57,600
the Spine, Inception, and Impact Mapping.

15
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,552
[Chapter 1]

16
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,088
AMY WAGNER: So Anna maybe you
can tell us a little bit about your product.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:09,856
ANNA BOWERS: Yes, so I work
for a publisher based in the UK.

18
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,568
And I sit on the web team as a product manager.

19
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:18,832
And we're just about to
kick off an exciting new product.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,904
And we've done about 3 or 4 months of
discovery work, and we're looking to get into sprint.

21
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:30,672
It's going to be an online learning tool.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,456
It started with a print element and we're
going to take some of that and put it online,

23
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,688
so there's a digital element:
and that's the bit I'm working on.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,480
It consists of a course book
and some practice books.

25
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,704
We need to host audio files
that go with the course book online

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,648
And we also need to put
some practice exercises online.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,448
And potentially monetize
them and create user accounts.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,984
And track progress of the users.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,672
AW: If you were to describe your
product in one sentence... how would you do that?

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,088
AB: Alright, let me have a go.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,968
So it's an online self study tool for adult learners...

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,544
that let's them track their progress.

33
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,460
[New Chapter]

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,712
AW: Right, so Anna, let's
do an exercise called the spine.

35
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:39,808
The spine is something that you should
be doing with your team and your stakeholders

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,968
So we're going to run through it together now...

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
AB: So that I can take it away.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,184
AW: Yes, exactly, so we can practice
the technique and you can take it away.

39
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:55,952
So we will to start with two minutes of individual
ideas that come to you about the product.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,680
So one idea per poster note, and single
words or very short sentences if you can,

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,960
to describe the product... the kind
of tone... maybe to describe what it's doing,

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,456
what problems it might be solving for the user.

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,960
I don't want to give you any more guidance than
that because I want to see what you come up with.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's do that now. I'll hand you this.

45
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:24,780
AB: Sticky notes.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:33,488
AW: Yes. OK so as many ideas as you
can muster, one per 'post it' note... two minutes.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,264
Let's go. AB: OK.

48
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:43,904
AB: Alright, so the fist one is
that it's an online learning tool.

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,448
That's what it is in the basic sense.

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,544
It gives a sense of progression for anyone using it.

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,136
It's got a professional tone

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:01,984
It's got a visual tone as well, because
the company is aesthetic, it's very visual.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,112
So there are a lot of bright images,
and things like that, to help with online learning.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:16,224
And it's self-led as well, so it's instructional
but it's for people to use without a teacher.

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,576
AW: Nice... I like it.

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:26,624
Good, so at this point, if we were doing this
exercise with your stakeholders and your team,

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:36,320
We would go round one by one to everyone
in the room (ideally not more than about 10 people),

58
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:43,808
and explain to the group the reasons for
why they did it, exactly like you just did it then.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,832
And once everyone has gone
round and explained their 'post it' notes

60
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,008
So what we do then is cluster.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,152
AB: Yes, and hopefully
there will be lots of similar ideas.

62
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,088
AW: Yes, that's the idea... you reach
a kind of alignment through clustering.

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,872
Someone might say self-led and someone else
might say something like self leading [laughter].

64
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,040
Are there any here that you think
look similar? No they all look different.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,144
There are inaud things...

66
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:27,472
Right, so let's say we've got
some others that are clustered here.

67
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,432
I've put my ideas down in inaud

68
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:42,960
Typically you get a bigger cluster on a
certain few of them, and others become outliers.

69
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,272
And they are the ones that only a couple
of people, or only one person has thought about.

70
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,608
And then it's quite easy to
see where popular opinion lies.

71
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,784
Typically at that point we also do a little bit of inaud.

72
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,816
I'm going to give you some stickers.
My favorites at the moment are stars: you can use any.

73
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:11,408
If you don't have any stickers...
AB: Buy some! AW: Yes. [laughter].
