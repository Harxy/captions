NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,760
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:10,048
In this bonus material,
independent Agile coach Amy Wagner

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,488
introduces the Agile Manifesto.

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:20,600
ANY WAGNER: A lot of things I'm
inspired by come from other peoples work.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,208
Lots of techniques, some principles,
and values from the Agile Manifesto.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,744
And even from the leading
software development world as well.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,728
So the first thing I would normally
look to do, when I'm working with a new person,

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,392
is just to step back to the Agile Manifesto.

10
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:51,376
And this looks very much like an
early 2000 website, as you can see here.

11
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,752
There was a bunch of people who got
together in 2001 and came up with the manifesto

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,584
for Agile software development.

13
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:07,370
And I think a lot of people don't
take the time to go over these things,

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,480
When they're delivering projects with Agility.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,760
Sometimes they will go straight to
Scrum, or a very specific methodology.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,464
So let's go through this, just
to remind ourselves what it is.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,680
The high level...

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,064
ANNA BOWERS: The principles. AW: Exactly.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,160
So the Manifesto... they say: 

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,640
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.

21
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,896
Through this work we have come to value:

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,424
Individuals and interactions
over processes and tools.

23
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,968
Working software over
comprehensive documentation.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,776
Customer collaboration
over contract negotiation.

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,800
And responding to change over following a plan.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,240
And what they've got at the
bottom, a bit of a caveat there,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
that yes, things on the right here are important, 

28
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:06,832
but things on the left is where the
emphasis should be as they are more important.

29
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:12,208
So just thinking on that
for a second... working software.

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,312
I think that's where the emphasis is if
you just look at the second one there.
