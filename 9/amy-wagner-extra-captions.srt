00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,544
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,760
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:10,048
In this bonus material,
independent Agile coach Amy Wagner

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,488
introduces the Agile Manifesto.

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:20,600
ANY WAGNER: A lot of things I'm
inspired by come from other peoples work.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,208
Lots of techniques, some principles,
and values from the Agile Manifesto.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,744
And even from the leading
software development world as well.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,728
So the first thing I would normally
look to do, when I'm working with a new person,

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,392
is just to step back to the Agile Manifesto.

10
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:51,376
And this looks very much like an
early 2000 website, as you can see here.

11
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,752
There was a bunch of people who got
together in 2001 and came up with the manifesto

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,584
for Agile software development.

13
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:07,370
And I think a lot of people don't
take the time to go over these things,

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,480
When they're delivering projects with Agility.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,760
Sometimes they will go straight to
Scrum, or a very specific methodology.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,464
So let's go through this, just
to remind ourselves what it is.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,680
The high level...

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,064
ANNA BOWERS: The principles. AW: Exactly.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,160
So the Manifesto... they say:

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,640
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.

21
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,896
Through this work we have come to value:

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,424
Individuals and interactions
over processes and tools.

23
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,968
Working software over
comprehensive documentation.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,776
Customer collaboration
over contract negotiation.

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,800
And responding to change over following a plan.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,240
And what they've got at the
bottom, a bit of a caveat there,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
that yes, things on the right here are important,

28
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:06,832
but things on the left is where the
emphasis should be as they are more important.

29
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:12,208
So just thinking on that
for a second... working software.

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,312
I think that's where the emphasis is if
you just look at the second one there.

31
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:24,800
Rather than writing a big long
technical specification about building the thing,

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,096
we want to get much closer and inaud about making the software, and doing the thing.

33
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:40,864
People used to put months
or years into designing an upfront idea

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:49,744
Maybe it would be a thing of beauty
that  you would frame and put on the wall.

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,072
[Laughter]

36
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,176
And still at that point
it's still something on paper.

37
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,368
And not what we are ultimately aiming
for, which is to build some software 

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,712
and get it out there to users.

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:12,048
And the other thing worth noting
here is the responding to change part.

40
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:19,100
I think culturally that can be hard if you
come from a traditional product manager world.

41
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,616
This inaud thing, did you ever hear those words?

42
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,384
AB: Yes, you define it all
upfront and then new things come

43
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,800
and that's called scope creep I suppose isn't it?

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,776
AW: Exactly, and we've got mission creep uhm...

45
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:38,928
But maybe it's like that for a reason, maybe
we're just continuing to try to improve a service.

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,016
And rather than sticking to what
we thought the thing was originally

47
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,416
And guarding that project plan or inaud.

48
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,448
This challenges to respond to
change in user needs and the market.

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,616
And respond to changing technologies and
language and best practices, things like that.

50
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,008
AB: OK.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,832
AW: So, the other thing I was going to look
at here quickly was the principles of the Manifesto.

52
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,880
There's twelve of these, and
rather than go through them verbatim, 

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,448
let's just pick out a few that
could be interesting, or worth noting.

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,856
The first one, get it out the door as fast as possible.

55
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:35,472
Early and continuous delivery of
the thing, the software, the content, 

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:43,632
all of that stuff that becomes the final product,
rather than delivering documentation about it.

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,280
Again, we talked about changing requirements...
we welcome them even late in development.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,048
That's quite a cultural change from
the more traditional design up front.

59
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,712
And then we've got do it frequently, from
a couple of weeks to a couple of months.

60
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,680
inaud we've been a week or two week time period. sometimes a month.

61
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,752
With a preference for the shorter timescale.

62
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,784
Have you though about how frequently you wanted...

63
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,360
AB: Well the other projects I'm working with,

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
(and I'll be sharing the inaud source,
which is one of the challenges we have),

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,368
they work to three week sprints,
so we'll probably be mirroring that.

66
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:33,776
They're already in sprints with other products
and I'll be mirroring that, so yes three weeks.

67
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,800
AW: Three weeks, ok cool.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,104
AB: We've started off
other projects a little bit shorter,

69
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,624
but three weeks is workable
for our team, so still quite short.

70
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,168
AW: Yes, it is, it's not three
months is it, or three years. [Laughter]

71
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,408
Some people launch after three
years of thinking about something.

72
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,224
Yes, so that's great, we'll get into
to the detail of that in a little bit.

73
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,496
The other thing here is talking
about business people and developers

74
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,160
working together daily throughout the project.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,648
It sounds like your
development team is on site with you?

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,960
AB: They are yes.

77
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,312
Do you mean business people as in stakeholders,

78
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,352
other people around the business
that have something to do with the project?

79
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,736
AW: Yes ideally. 

80
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,720
As product manager you're going to be the
person who helps to translate those requirements.

81
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,552
But if at all possible, you can bring
the subject matter experts into the room.

82
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:43,808
And the people who are owning
that strategy for the learning tool.

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,168
If the inaud get's a chance to work with him closely on a day to day basis

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,312
I think that's the most ideal situation.

85
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,120
AB: That would be awesome.

86
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:04,560
AW: A lot of people do that by inviting them to
key meetings throughout your three week process.

87
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:09,168
The other bit here is about motivated individuals.

88
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,648
AB: Lots of sweets! [Laughter]

89
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,120
AW: Or carrots!

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,368
AB: Carrots, oh my gosh that's very healthy. [Laughter]

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,760
AW: Makes you see in the dark.

92
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:30,880
But... in general designing the environment to
give people the support they need to get the job done,

93
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,104
is so important... motivating people
to get great work done, on a daily basis.

94
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,640
AB: Yes, we did those inaud personality tests recently

95
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,208
And you would think that
developers would be very detail focused,

96
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,184
well they are, but a lot of them
also appreciated the bigger picture,

97
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,776
and that helps to motivate them,
so it was really good to recognise that.

98
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,992
As well as them needing strict requirements, you
also want to tell them why your building something.

99
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:04,832
AW: That's such a good point and goes
back to the point about business people 

100
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,400
and developers... delivery people working together.

101
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:15,360
That also brings that holistic
theme of why you're there.

102
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
Not just: "here's a list, do your best".

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
AB: Exactly, yes.

104
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,688
AW: It allows people to ask why,
and also have a two way design process

105
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,880
so that people can simplify a requirement as well,

106
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,744
rather than just dealing with
something that's passed down from on high.

107
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,344
So it has to be a two way thing.

108
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:46,368
OK, we also have the most efficient and
effective method of conveying information

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,552
'to and withing a development
team is face to face conversation'

110
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,672
I guess this is why you often see a lot
of Agile teams doing stand ups in the morning.

111
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,120
We'll go into what that is in a bit.

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,744
They're just daily face to face contact
where you talk about what you've been up to.

113
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,176
And talk about anything
that might be blocking that.

114
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:18,816
Do you have any developers working from home or...

115
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,232
AB: We've got a couple that work 4 days a
week from home and then come in for a day,

116
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,584
which is when we catch up with them.

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,880
But most of them are in the office, so it's a mix.

118
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,936
AW: I've seen some teams work with a continuous
video link available to someone who's at home.

119
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,216
So it feels like they're in the
room with you, or the rest of the team.

120
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,840
AB: It sounds very futuristic.

121
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,344
AW: The future has arrived,
it's just not widely distributed.

122
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,296
The other one here, working software,
working services, delivering the thing.

123
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,728
That is the primary measure of progress.

124
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,528
AB: That's interesting yes I'm interested to learn a bit more about the definition of inaud.

125
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,952
AW: Because we have some tricky ones.

126
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:15,968
I think that's challenging the traditional
project management of doing things.
AW: Because we have some tricky ones.

127
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:22,032
I think that's challenging the traditional
project management of doing things.

128
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:28,400
Have you ever heard of a rag status report RAG?

129
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,448
It's a red, amber green status.

130
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,440
AB: Oh... yes.

131
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,496
Red, amber green, a RAG. inaud

132
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:49,712
The idea is that rather than just
declaring how you think the project is doing,

133
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:56,992
Red being terrible, like... this is
something I need to flag as a problem.

134
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,024
Amber means we might have
a problem and green being OK.

135
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,816
Rather than doing that, shall we go
"did we ship some software this week?"

136
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:11,150
"Did we deliver the thing, are users using it"?

137
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,992
AB: Like measuring our goals.

138
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,448
And then we really are halfway
through trying to solve our problem

139
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,112
AB: I like that.

140
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:29,104
AW: I think it's less of an abstraction away from doing the thing, inaud RAG status report
